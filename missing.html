<!-- FIXME: is there a better way to do this?  We need to propagate
 content to the "as-page-title" and "as-page-subtitle" place-holders,
 within the "page-content" div of "index.html"; our javascript page
 loader will explicitly look for these hidden elements, and copy
 their content into the corresponding visible place-holders.

<p>The MinGW.org web&#8209;site is undergoing an overhaul,
whilst in the process of transferring to a new hosting provider.
During this transitional phase,
some pages may be temporarily unavailable.
</p>
<p>If you see this notification page,
it is likely that the content you are trying to access
has not yet been transferred;
please check back later,
or file a feature request for a priority review,
(but please leave the actual priority assignment to
the discretion of the project administrators).
