<h3>General Enquiries</h3>
<button>What is MinGW?</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>Created by Colin Peters,
and released to the public domain,
the original MinGW&#8239;&mdash;&#8239;or &#8220;Minimalist GNU for
Windows&#8221;&#8239;&mdash;&#8239;was a system of import libraries,
header files, and supporting &#8220;glue&#8221; code,
to facilitate the use of Microsoft&#8217;s
<code>CRTDLL.DLL</code>&#8239;&mdash;&#8239;and
later <code>MSVCRT.DLL</code>&#8239;&mdash;&#8239;as
the primary run&#8209;time support for a native MS&#8209;Windows port
of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), and its supporting utilities,
(which, in turn, were originally provided by Jan&#8209;Jaap van der Heijden).
</p>
<p>Today, MinGW has become synonymous with the entire system comprising
these GNU tools, a significantly extended derivative of Colin&#8217;s
original run&#8209;time system, together with complementary import libraries,
and headers, to facilitate access to the MS&#8209;Windows&nbsp;API, a further
collection of complementary libraries, and utilities, and even the native
MS&#8209;Windows environment in which they run, providing a complete
Open&nbsp;Source programming tool set which is suitable for the development
of native MS&#8209;Windows applications, with no implicit dependency on any
3rd&#8209;party C&#8209;Runtime DLL.
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>What is MSYS?</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>A contraction of &#8220;Minimal SYStem&#8221;,
originally conceived by Earnie Boyd, and implemented as
a light&#8209;weight fork of Cygwin&#8209;1.3,
MSYS is a Bourne shell command line interpreter system
for use on the MS&#8209;Windows platform.
Offered as a general purpose alternative to Microsoft&#8217;s
<code>cmd.exe</code>, it is accompanied by a small selection
of Unix tools, making it particularly suitable,
in conjunction with MinGW,
for porting of many Open Source applications
to the MS&#8209;Windows plarform.
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>What is W32API?</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>Created by Anders Norlander,
<code>w32api</code> is a system of import libaries, and header files,
complementing Colin Peters&#8217; original bindings for Microsoft&#8217;s
<code>CRTDLL.DLL</code>, by the addition of bindings for Microsoft&#8217;s
32&#8209;bit &#8220;Windows Application Programming Interface&#8221;.
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>What is the &#8220;mingw&#8209;ports&#8221; framework?</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>Originally conceived by Earnie Boyd,
and promoted under the name &#8220;<code>mingwPORT</code>&#8221;,
this is a system of Bourne shell scripts, designed to facilitate
building of MinGW applications, by end users, directly from the
upstream source code.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as originally conceived,
the <code>mingwPORT</code> system exhibited a number of flaws.
In recognition of this, Charles (Chuck) Wilson, developed a replacement,
derived from Cygwin&#8217;s &#8220;<code>cygport</code>&#8221; system,
which he called &#8220;<code>mgwport</code>&#8221;.
This, in turn, was found to be rather unsatisfactory,
and has since been supplanted by the
&#8220;<code>mingw-port</code>&#8221; subsidiary of
&#8220;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://osdn.net/users/keith/pf/mingw.pkg/"
>the <code>mingw&#8209;pkg</code> system</a>&#8221;.

distributed via the <code>mingw&#8209;ports</code> framework,

</div><!-- answer -->
<button>How can I get help, if I can&#8217;t find an answer here?</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>Presumably,
you have exhausted all resources on this web&#8209;site,
<em>and</em>&hairsp; a search of <em>all</em>&hairsp;
of the MinGW mailing&#8209;list archives,
(both current,
<em>and</em>&hairsp; historical),
and you have found
nothing pertinent to your problem.
You <em>may</em>&hairsp; find an answer
on some 3rd&#8209;party web&#8209;site;
however,
<em>caveat emptor</em>&hairsp;: such web&#8209;sites are often
sources of ill&#8209;advised,
and even <em>downright wrong</em>&hairsp;,
information!
Instead,
we <em>strongly</em>&hairsp; recommend that
you <em>subscribe</em>&hairsp; to the
<a target="_blank" href="index.html?page=mailing.html#mingw-users"
>MinGW&#8209;Users mailing list</a>,
post a message explaining your problem,
and ask for advice.
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>Why do I receive persistent rejection notifications,
when I attempt to post messages to the MinGW&#8209;Users mailing list?
</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>To protect the list, and its subscribers,
from a proliferation of <em>spam</em>&hairsp;, the
<a target="_blank" href="index.html?page=mailing.html#mingw-users"
>MinGW&#8209;Users mailing list</a> will reject any messages
which are posted by non&#8209;subscribers;
thus, to avoid the rejection notifications, you <em>must</em>&hairsp;
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://lists.osdn.me/mailman/listinfo/mingw-users"
>subscribe</a>, and you <em>must</em>&hairsp; post <em>only</em>&hairsp;
from your subscribed address.
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>I <em>have</em>&hairsp;
subscribed to the MinGW&#8209;Users mailing list;
why do I continue to receive rejection notifications,
when I post messages?
</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>You may not have fully completed the subscription process.
After submitting the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://lists.osdn.me/mailman/listinfo/mingw-users"
>subscription request form</a>, you will receive a confirmation request,
(via e&#8209;mail to the address for which you requested your subscription).
You <em>must</em>&hairsp; respond to this confirmation request,
following the instructions contained therein;
until you do so, your subscription will <em>not</em>&hairsp; become active.
</p>
<p>If you did not receive a confirmation request,
then please check that your e&#8209;mail client, or your service provider,
has not directed it into your junk folder, (or any other folder which you
may not habitually monitor).
</p>
<p>If you believe that you <em>have</em>&hairsp;
completed the subscription process,
then please double check that the address from which you are trying to post
<em>exactly</em>&hairsp; matches that which you subscribed.
You may wish to use the auto&#8209;responding
<a href="mailto:mingw-users-request@lists.osdn.me?subject=password"
>password reminder request</a>, and/or
<a href="mailto:mingw-users-request@lists.osdn.me?subject=help"
>subscription help request</a> services to verify the status
of your subscription; if you submit a request of each type,
in this order, and you receive a response to the help request,
but you do not receive a password reminder,
then there is no active subscription for your address.
</p>
<p>If a password reminder request <em>does</em>&hairsp; elicit a reply,
but you still receive rejection notifications when you post to the list,
then you may have a legitimate justification to
<a href="mailto:mingw-users-owner@lists.osdn.me"
>seek administrative assistance</a>.
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>Can I use the administrative address
to communicate with the MinGW Developers?
</button>
<div class="answer">
<p><em>Absolutely not</em>&hairsp;!
The administrative address is <em>strictly</em>&hairsp; reserved for
administrative communications; if you attempt to abuse it for
any other purpose, you will receive no reply.
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>If I cannot use the administrative address,
what mechanism <em>is</em>&hairsp; available for direct communication
with the MinGW Developers?
</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>You should subscribe, and post a message to the
<a target="_blank" href="index.html?page=mailing.html#mingw-users"
>MinGW&#8209;Users mailing list</a>.
If one of the developers decides that your enquiry merits his,
or her attention, he, or she will reply.
Any such reply may, or may not, initiate an off&#8209;list dialogue;
whether it does so, or not, is at the discretion of the developer;
<em>you</em>&hairsp; have no right to,
nor should you have any expectation of,
such preferential attention.
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>Is there a release schedule for MinGW software packages?
If there is, where can I find it?
</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>There is no formal release schedule.
MinGW is developed, and maintained, by a very few unpaid volunteers.
Each contributing volunteer will publish updated versions of the packages
which they maintain,
on an <em>ad hoc</em>&hairsp; basis, as and when they are ready.
Attempting to impose a strict schedule will only engender frustration,
and will be counterproductive.
</p>
<p>The next release, of whatever package you are waiting for,
will be published when it is ready; if you want it sooner,
please feel free to contribute to the effort of getting it ready.

<h3>Compiling and Linking Issues</h3>
<button>Why can&#8217;t the MinGW compilers find my project&#8217;s
header files?
</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>Unless your project&#8217;s header files are placed in directories
which are already in the compiler&#8217;s default &#8220;include file
search path&#8221;, <em>you</em>&hairsp; must specify compiler options,
such as &#8220;<code>-I</code>&nbsp;<code><em>path</em></code>&thinsp;&#8221;,
&#8220;<code>-iquote</code>&nbsp;<code><em>path</em></code>&thinsp;&#8221;, or
&#8220;<code>-isystem</code>&nbsp;<code><em>path</em></code>&thinsp;&#8221;,
to indicate where your header files may be found.
</p>
<p>A comprehensive discussion of this issue, and potential solutions,
may be found in <a target="_blank" href="index.html?page=isystem.html"
>this MinGW user guide</a>.
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>How do I specify the libraries to be searched by the MinGW linker?
</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>Assuming that your libraries are correctly named,
according to one of the conventions described in
<a target="_blank" href="index.html?page=libspec.html"
>this user guide</a>, you should add references of the form
&#8220;<code>-l<em>name</em></code>&thinsp;&#8221; for each required library,
ensuring that each such reference is placed <em>after</em>&hairsp;
all named source and object files which refer to it,
<em>and</em>&hairsp;, if any library refers to another,
that the <em>referring</em>&hairsp; library is named <em>before</em>&hairsp;
any to which it refers; (note: in the event of circular references among
libraries&#8239;&mdash;&#8239;a design fault&#8239;&mdash;&#8239;this
may require some libraries to be named more than once).
</p>
<p>Moreover, if any named library cannot be found in the
linker&#8217;s default search path, you may also need to specify
&#8220;<code>-L</code>&nbsp;<code><em>path</em></code>&thinsp;&#8221;
options, as advised in
<a target="_blank" href="index.html?page=libpath.html"
>this additional user guide</a>.
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>Why does the MinGW linker
persistently report &#8220;undefined reference&#8221; errors,
when I have specified all of the libraries
which are required to link my application?
</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>There are several reasons why the linker may report
&#8220;undefined reference&#8221; errors.
Typically, you may be attempting to use a system function,
which simply isn&#8217;t natively supported on MS&#8209;Windows,
(and thus, is <em>not</em>&hairsp; provided within any MinGW system library);
alternatively, you may have neglected to specify some library,
which is needed to provide the missing functionality.
</p>
<p>If you are certain that neither of these is the problem,
then it is likely that you are falling foul of a common issue,
which is most often entirely attributable to user error:
the GNU linker (and hence, the MinGW linker)
is a <em>single pass</em>&hairsp; linker, and thus,
successful linking is <em>crucially dependent</em>&hairsp; on
the order in which source files, object modules,
and library references are specified,
on the command line;
unfortunately,
and all too frequently,
many <em>users</em>&hairsp; seem to get this <em>fatally wrong</em>&hairsp;.
You <em>must</em>&hairsp; ensure that <em>every</em>&hairsp; library reference
is placed <em>after</em>&hairsp; every specified object module,
(whether explicitly specified, or implicitly compiled),
which depends on it.
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>Why does a compile and link command,
which works fine on GNU/Linux,
report &#8220;undefined reference&#8221; errors,
when invoked <em>identically</em>&hairsp; on MinGW?
</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>Assuming that
all of the unresolved references can actually be satisfied,
from the set of libraries which have been specified,
this is almost certainly another manifestation
of the same user error as identified in the previous answer.
The order in which sources, object files, and libraries
are specified, on the command line, may be incorrect,
<em>both</em>&hairsp; for MinGW, <em>and</em>&hairsp; for GNU/Linux;
however, the ELF version of the GNU linker,
as used on GNU/Linux, may forgive unresolved references,
in the particular case of symbols which are defined
in a prematurely&#8209;specified <em>shared</em>&hairsp; library,
whereas MinGW&#8217;s PE&#8209;COFF linker will <em>not</em>&hairsp;
forgive this.
</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just the way it is.
Technically, this is as much an error for the GNU/Linux case,
as it is for MinGW; we recommend that you <em>should</em>&hairsp;
correct the errant GNU/Linux usage; you <em>must</em>&hairsp;
correct it for MinGW.
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>My application compiles, and links fine,
but the executable is <em>huge</em>&hairsp;; why is this?
</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>The most common reason,
for executables being larger than expected,
is that they include <em>debugging information</em>&hairsp;;
(this is added when object modules are compiled with GCC&#8217;s
&#8216;<code>&#8209;g</code>&#8217; option).
Even if you do not use &#8216;<code>&#8209;g</code>&#8217;,
when compiling your own code,
some of the libraries with which you link,
(including system libraries distributed by MinGW.OSDN),
may incorporate debugging information,
and this can have a significant effect
on the size of executables.
</p>
<p>If the size of your executables is inflated by debugging information,
you may use the <code>strip</code> command to remove it;
alternatively, you may specify GCC&#8217;s &#8216;<code>&#8209;s</code>&#8217;
option, when you link the executables, to achieve the same effect.
</p>
<p>Other factors,
which may contribute to inflation of the size of executables,
and the techniques which may be employed to mitigate them,
are discussed in the user guide:
<a target="_blank" href="index.html?page=exesize.html"
>HOWTO Reduce the Size of MinGW Executable Files</a>.
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>Why does a recompiled executable differ from the original,
when I haven&#8217;t changed the source, or any compiler options?
</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>The <em>run&#8209;time behaviours</em>&hairsp; of
the two executables should be identical.
However, the MinGW GCC compiler <em>does not</em>&hairsp; guarantee
to produce consistent output, between any two compilations of the
same source; differences in recorded meta&#8209;data, (e.g.
compilation date), will be sufficient to introduce byte&#8209;level
diferences; furthermore, there is no guarantee that the ordering
of the generated code will remain identical.
</p>
<p>It may be possible to achieve consistent output,
by patching GCC itself, but doing so is beyond the scope
of MinGW&#8217;s documentation.
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>What should I do when the compiler reports an
&#8220;internal error&#8221;?
</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>If you see a diagnostic message similar to this:
</p><pre class="box-out">
../include/wx/ctrlsub.h:156: internal error: Segmentation fault
</pre><p>then try running the same compilation command again.
</p>
<p>If the same error message is reproduced,
then you may have stumbled upon a genuine compiler defect.
You should try to create a <em>minimal reproducible test case</em>&hairsp;,
(i.e.&nbsp;an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="http://www.sscce.org"
>SSCCE</a>), and post it, along with a request for advice, on the
<a target="_blank" href="index.html?page=mailing.html#mingw-users"
>MinGW&#8209;Users mailing list</a>;
others may have already encountered the same problem,
and be able to help.
</p>
<p>Conversely,
if the error is <em>not consistently reproducible</em>&hairsp;,
you may have a hardware fault;
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/"
>this third&#8209;party FAQ</a> may help to explain the issue.
</p>
<p>As a work&#8209;around,
if you have encountered a <em>persistently reproducible</em>&hairsp;
<dfn>ICE</dfn> (internal compiler error), then you may be able
to circumvent it by recompiling at a different (likely lower)
level of optimization; (however, you should not allow this,
if successful, to discourage you from reporting the issue).
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>I believe I have identified a MinGW bug; how should I report it?
</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>Firstly,
you should double check your own code,
to ensure that it is completely valid;
sadly,
many submitted bug reports turn out to result from user error,
so if you are in <em>any</em>&hairsp; doubt,
we recommend that you seek advice from
<a target="_blank" href="index.html?page=mailing.html#mingw-users"
>the MinGW&#8209;Users mailing list</a> community,
<em>before</em>&hairsp; filing a formal bug report.
</p>
<p>If you <em>do</em>&hairsp; decide to submit a formal bug report,
you should proceed as advised in
<a target="_blank" href="index.html?page=buginfo.html"
>these bug reporting guidelines</a>.

<h3>Software Portability Issues</h3>
<button>Can I use libraries compiled by other compilers,
(e.g. MSVC), with MinGW?
</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>This depends on the interfaces exposed by the library.
In general, any interface which is exposed using
<code>extern</code>&nbsp;<code>&quot;C&quot;</code>
linkage, (as is the case for many of the MS&#8209;Windows&nbsp;API
library function interfaces), will be compatible; on the other hand,
interfaces which are exposed using <code>C++</code> linkage,
(or any other language linkage protocol,
which is not <em>strictly</em>&hairsp;
<code>extern</code>&nbsp;<code>&quot;C&quot;</code> compatible),
are unlikely to be usable.
</p>
</div><!-- answer -->
<button>MinGW&#8217;s <code>printf()</code> doesn&#8217;t seem
to support the C99 <code>%ll</code> format modifier; how can I format
a C99 <code>long</code>&nbsp;<code>long</code> value?
</button>
<div class="answer">
<p>MinGW&#8217;s <code>printf()</code> <em>does</em>&hairsp; support
the <code>%ll</code> format modifier; however, Microsoft&#8217;s
<code>MSVCRT.DLL</code> implementation, (which is what MinGW uses
<em>by default</em>&hairsp;), does not.
</p>
<p>If you want to continue to use the <code>MSVCRT.DLL</code>
implementation of <code>printf()</code>, then to format a C99
<code>long</code>&nbsp;<code>long</code> value, you must use
Microsoft&#8217;s <em>non&#8209;standard</em>&hairsp; <code>I64</code>
format modifier, instead of the standard C99 <code>%ll</code> modifier.
</p>
<p>Conversely, if you prefer C99 standard <code>printf()</code>
compatibility, then you <em>must</em>&hairsp; elect to use the
<code>libmingwrt.a</code> implementation of <code>printf()</code>,
(and its formatted I/O siblings), when you compile your code;
<em>any one</em>&hairsp; of the following
<em>formally sanctioned</em>&hairsp;
techniques is sufficient to achieve this:
</p><ul style="margin-left: -0.8em">
<li>Compile your code with GCC&#8217;s <code>-posix</code> option.
</li>
<li>Permanently <em>enable</em>&hairsp; the <code>__MINGW_ANSI_STDIO__</code>
feature, by editing MinGW&#8217;s <code>&lt;features.h&gt;</code> file;
(supported from <code>libmingwrt.a</code> version 5.2.1 onwards).
</li>
<li><code>#define</code> either <code>_GNU_SOURCE</code>, or
<code>_BSD_SOURCE</code>, <em>before</em>&hairsp; any <code>#include</code>
statement, which may cause any system header file to be included;
(neither macro requires an associated value).
</li>
<li><code>#define</code>&nbsp;<code>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</code>, with
any of the non&#8209;zero values specified by the POSIX standard;
if unspecified, at the time when the first <code>#include</code>
statement, if any, which causes any system header file to be
included, MinGW will <em>implicitly</em>&hairsp; behave as if a value
of <code>200809L</code> had been specified, but an <em>explicit</em>&hairsp;
definition is required, to override the <code>MSVCRT.DLL</code>
implementation of <code>printf()</code>.
</li>
<li><code>#define</code>&nbsp;<code>_XOPEN_SOURCE</code>, with any
of the values prescribed by the POSIX standard; once again, such a
definition <em>must</em>&hairsp; precede <em>all</em>&hairsp;
<code>#include</code> statements which may cause inclusion of
any system header file; it has the same effect as an <em>explicit</em>&hairsp;
definition of <code>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</code>,
at the equivalent conformity level.
</li></ul>
