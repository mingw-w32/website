<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This Mini&#8209;HOWTO answers the question:
<em>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t the MinGW compilers find
my project&#8217;s header files?&#8221;</em>
</p>
<p>Prior to the publication of the <em>GCC&#8209;7</em> documentation,
(when the wording changed, to provide only a brief outline of
<a href="#default-search">the identification method described below</a>),
the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.5/cpp/index.html#Top">CPP Section</a>
of the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/index.html#dir">GCC Manual</a>
indicated that header files may be located in
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.5/cpp/Search-Path.html#Search-Path"
>the following directories</a>:&ndash;
</p>
<div class="box-out">
<p>On a normal Unix system, if you do not instruct it otherwise,
[GCC] will look for headers requested with
<code>#include</code>&nbsp;<code>&lt;file&gt;</code> in:
</p><pre>
     /usr/local/include
     libdir/gcc/target/version/include
     /usr/target/include
     /usr/include
</pre>
<p>For <code>C++</code> programs,
it will also look in <code>/usr/include/g++-v3</code>, first.
</p></div>
<p>Of course, the
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/p15691"
>MinGW ports of GCC</a>
target Microsoft&#8217;s Windows system,
which is <em><strong>not</strong></em>
a <em>&#8220;normal UNIX system&#8221;</em>.
Nevertheless, many users,
particularly those coming from a UNIX or GNU/Linux background,
and especially when they use MSYS to emulate a UNIX file system model
on their MS&#8209;Windows hosts,
are surprised to find that MinGW,
using its default configuration,
does <em><strong>not</strong></em> automatically
search for header files in these directories.
</p>
</div><!-- introduction -->
<div class="overlapped" id="default-search">
<h3>Identifying MinGW&#8217;s Default Include Path</h3>
<p>So,
if MinGW compilers don&#8217;t search in these <em>&#8220;normal&#8221;</em> directories,
where <em><strong>do</strong></em> they search?
</p>
<p>Before answering this,
it may be useful to understand <em>why</em>
the MinGW compilers do not search in these directories.
Firstly, on a native MS&#8209;Windows host,
these directories do not typically exist;
the nature of the file system,
with multiple distinct roots
distributed over multiple distinctly named devices,
means that such path names would be ambiguous.
Secondly, since MinGW itself is <em>not</em> a suite of MSYS applications,
even if such directories are created in the MSYS environment,
being <em>native MS&#8209;Windows</em> applications,
the MinGW compilers would have no means to locate them.
</p>
<p>Thus,
to avoid imposing draconian restrictions on how users install MinGW,
the maintainers have chosen to adopt a restricted search paradigm,
which is determined on the basis of where MinGW is itself installed.
The actual search path,
for any specific installation of MinGW may be determined,
by running the compiler itself,
with the &#8216;<code>-v</code>&#8217; option;
typically, for a MinGW&#8209;GCC installation in <code>C:\MinGW</code>,
we might see something similar to the following,
from (the now dated, but nonetheless still typical)
MinGW&#8209;GCC&#8209;3.4.5:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>touch foo.c bar.cpp</kbd>
$ <kbd>gcc -v -c foo.c</kbd>
:
#include &quot;...&quot; search starts here:
#include &lt;...&gt; search starts here:
 c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/../../../../include
 c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/include
End of search list.
:

$ <kbd>g++ -v -c bar.cpp</kbd>
:
#include &quot;...&quot; search starts here:
#include &lt;...&gt; search starts here:
 c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/../../../../include/c++/3.4.5
 c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/../../../../include/c++/3.4.5/mingw32
 c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/../../../../include/c++/3.4.5/backward
 c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/../../../../include
 c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/include
End of search list.
:
</pre>
<p>This raw&#8209;format output, as displayed by the compilers,
may be difficult for human readers to interpret.
Thus, it may be helpful to reduce it to canonical path forms:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>gcc -v -c foo.c 2&gt;&amp;1 | sed ':1;s,/[^/.][^/]*/\.\./,/,;t 1'</kbd>

<h3>Other Directories Searched by Default</h3>
<p>The minimal list of directories,
identified as described above,
specifies the <em><strong>only</strong></em> locations
which will be searched <em><strong>by default</strong></em>,
for system header files,
or for headers associated with user installed libraries;
however, there is <em><strong>one</strong></em> exception.
Astute readers may have noticed that
the include file search path is itemised in a pair of sequential lists,
with the second being concatenated to the first; however, the first,
identified as the
<code>#include</code>&nbsp;<code>&quot;...&quot;</code>&nbsp;<code>search</code>
list appears to be empty.
In reality, this apparent emptiness may be misleading;
unless the user specifies the &#8216;<code>-I-</code>&#8217; option
when invoking GCC, this list contains <em>exactly</em> one directory:
the directory in which the source file containing the
<code>#include</code>&nbsp;<code>&quot;file&quot;</code> directive resides.
</p>
<p>Notice that this one additional directory
is <em><strong>not</strong></em> searched for headers specified
with the <code>#include</code>&nbsp;<code>&lt;file&gt;</code> form of
the <code>#include</code> directive;
it applies only for those headers specified using
the <code>#include</code>&nbsp;<code>&quot;file&quot;</code> form of the directive.
Also note that the location of this additional directory is not fixed;
it is dependent on the location of the source file being compiled,
and, while unique for each individual source file,
it may vary even within the compilation scope for any project,
<em>and even within the scope of a single translation unit</em>,
if multiple source files are distributed among different directories
in the project&#8217;s source hierarchy.
</p>
<p>To clarify this point,
let us consider a trivial example.
Suppose that we have a small project,
which provides all of it&#8217;s sources in a single directory;
among them we might have:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="box-out">
~/src
   :
   :--- bar.h
   :
   :--- foo.c
   :--- foo.h
   :
</pre>
<p>Further suppose that the file, <code>foo.c</code>,
includes the project&#8209;local header, <code>foo.h</code>:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="box-out">
/* foo.c
 */
 :
#include &quot;foo.h&quot;
 :
</pre>
<p>and that <code>foo.h</code>, in turn,
includes <code>bar.h</code>:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="box-out">
/* foo.h
 */
 :
#include &quot;bar.h&quot;
 :
</pre>
<p>With this arrangement,
we may create a build directory which is a sibling of <code>src</code>,
and with that as current directory,
we may compile <code>foo.c</code>:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>mkdir ~/build</kbd>
$ <kbd>cd ~/build</kbd>
$ <kbd>gcc -c ../src/foo.c</kbd>
$
</pre>
<p>and we might have every expectation that it will compile correctly;
it certainly should have no problem finding the pair of header files,
<code>foo.h</code> and <code>bar.h</code>.
</p>
<p>Now, suppose that the project grows
to such a size that we decide to separate our headers
into a subdirectory of <code>src</code>:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="box-out">
~/src
   :
   :--- foo.c
   :
   :--- hdr
   :     :
   :     :--- bar.h
   :     :--- foo.h
   :     :
</pre>
<p>After making this rearrangement,
if we again try to compile <code>foo.c</code>,
we will likely see errors resulting from the failure
to locate the header file <code>foo.h</code>:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>gcc -c ../src/foo.c</kbd>
../src/foo.c:3:17: foo.h: No such file or directory
 :
$
</pre>
<p>To correct this, we must also modify <code>foo.c</code>,
to reflect the relocation of the header files:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="box-out">
/* foo.c
 */
 :
#include &quot;hdr/foo.h&quot;
 :
</pre>
<p>and this should be sufficient to again let us compile
<code>foo.c</code> successfully:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>gcc -c ../src/foo.c</kbd>
$
</pre>
<p> Note here,
that we did <em><strong>not</strong></em> make any corresponding change
in <code>bar.h</code>; that would have been wrong!
The rule is that, in any <code>#include</code> directive of the form:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="box-out">#include &quot;path/file&quot;</pre>
<p><code>path</code> must be a <em><strong>relative</strong></em> path,
and it must be relative to the directory in which the file containing
the pertinent <code>#include</code> directive is itself located.
In our example,
since <code>foo.h</code> and <code>bar.h</code> are still
in the same directory,
searches for files included by either will commence in that same directory.
If we had changed <code>foo.h</code>,
in a manner similar to the change we made in <code>foo.c</code>,
then <code>foo.h</code> would have attempted
to <code>#include</code> the file <code>~/src/hdr/hdr/bar.h</code>,
instead of the intended <code>~/src/hdr/bar.h</code>.

<h3>Including Headers from Directories which are Not Searched by Default</h3>
<p>While the default header search paths may suffice
for many simple projects,
as project complexity grows,
it will often become more convenient to collect header files into
a central directory which is <em><strong>not</strong></em> in
the default search path;
this is particularly true of projects which provide,
and possibly install,
one or more function libraries,
either exclusively for their own use,
or maybe even for general use by other projects.
In such cases,
GCC must be <em><strong>explicitly</strong></em> notified,
by specifying appropriate command line options,
to identify the additional directories in which to search.
</p>
<p>The relevant sections of
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Preprocessor-Options.html#Preprocessor-Options"
>the GCC Manual</a>,
and its associated C preprocessor manual,
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Invocation.html#Invocation"
>document several options</a>,
which may be used to specify directories to search for header files;
of these,
the most widely used is the
<code>-I</code>&nbsp;<code><em>dir</em></code> option.
As an example of its use, let us reconsider the previous example,
with the project source files organised within the hierarchy:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="box-out">
~/src
   :
   :--- foo.c
   :
   :--- hdr
   :     :
   :     :--- bar.h
   :     :--- foo.h
   :     :
</pre>
<p>but this time,
we will <em><strong>not</strong></em> adapt <code>foo.c</code>
to locate <code>foo.h</code> using the default include file search path:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="box-out">
/* foo.c
 */
 :
#include &quot;foo.h&quot;
 :
</pre>
<p>As we saw previously,
if we try to compile this unmodified <code>foo.c</code>,
without explicitly specifying any header search path,
the compilation will fail:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>gcc -c ../src/foo.c</kbd>
../src/foo.c:3:17: foo.h: No such file or directory
 :
$
</pre>
<p>Previously,
we corrected this failure by modifying <code>foo.c</code>,
to bring <code>foo.h</code> into the
default <code>#include</code>&nbsp;<code>&quot;...&quot;</code> search path.
This time, we will correct it, not by modifying <code>foo.c</code>,
but by <em><strong>explicitly</strong></em> adding our project&#8217;s
local <code>hdr</code> directory to the search path,
when we invoke GCC to compile <code>foo.c</code>:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>gcc -I ../src/hdr -c ../src/foo.c</kbd>
$
</pre>
<p>which, we may observe, again results in successful compilation.
</p>

<div class="overlapped" id="third-party">
<h3>Using Headers Provided with Locally Installed External Libraries</h3>
<p>Many projects have dependencies on external libraries,
which are <em>not</em> provided by a standard MinGW installation.
Users who wish to build the applications provided by such projects
must first install the appropriate prerequisite libraries.
Such libraries are referred to as
<em>&#8220;locally installed libraries&#8221;</em>,
and they must be installed such that MinGW&#8217;s GCC can readily
locate both the libraries themselves,
<em>and</em> any header files installed as prerequisites
for specifying the interface to the library functions.
</p>
<p>The installation of
such external libraries may be viewed as a challenge,
for some users.
Typically,
and particularly in the case of library packages
originally developed for Unix&#8209;like platforms,
such libraries would be installed into
the <code>/usr/local/...</code> directory hierarchy.
However, as we have seen above,
MinGW&#8217;s GCC
does not consider any such hierarchy in its default search paths,
either for header files, or for libraries.
Thus, the challenge is to choose an installation strategy
which achieves a satisfactory compromise between:&ndash;
</p>
<ol>
<li>Installing directly into MinGW&#8217;s own standard
 <code>&lt;mingw-root&gt;/include</code>
 and <code>&lt;mingw-root&gt;/lib</code> directory hierarchies;
 this offers the advantage that the libraries,
 and their associated header files,
 are placed directly into MinGW&#8209;GCC&#8217;s default search paths,
 so there is no additional burden placed on the user,
 to add additional <code>-I</code>&nbsp;<code><em>dir</em></code> options,
 throughout the build systems of any project using an external library.
 However, while perhaps being the simplest option,
 this strategy is not without its disadvantages:&ndash;
 <ul style="margin: 0.3em 0 0 -1em; list-style: disc">
 <li>The external library components are intermingled,
  within the file system hierarchy,
  with MinGW&#8217;s own standard components;
  it may not be straightforward to segregate them later,
  should this ever be necessary.
 </li>
 <li>Should the user wish to maintain <em>side&#8209;by&#8209;side</em>
  MinGW installations, at differing release point versions, say,
  then the external library installations will need to be duplicated,
  within each of the separate MinGW installation hierarchies.
 </li>
 <li>If the MinGW installation hierarchy is purged,
  in preparation for a clean re&#8209;installation,
  then any locally installed external libraries will also be purged,
  and if subsequently needed, will have to be reinstalled.
 </li>
</ul>
<li>Creating a separate directory hierarchy,
 into which all external library packages are installed;
 this mitigates the disadvantages of option (1),
 but introduces its own drawbacks:&ndash;
 <ul style="margin: 0.3em 0 0 -1em; list-style: disc">
 <li>The header files and libraries are no longer in
  MinGW GCC&#8217;s default search paths;
  thus the user <em><strong>must</strong></em> make provision
  to pass the appropriate <code>-I</code>&nbsp;<code><em>dir</em></code>,
  (and associated <code>-L</code>&nbsp;<code><em>dir</em></code>),
  options to GCC, through his own projects&#8217; build systems.
  (This may be mitigated, in turn, by customising the
  <a target="_blank" href="index.html?page=gccspecs.html"
  ><em>GCC Specs File</em></a>,
  to supply the necessary options <em>automatically</em>,
  for <em>all</em> invocations of GCC,
  or by appropriately defining GCC&#8217;s
  <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
   href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Environment-Variables.html#Environment-Variables"
  ><em>CPATH and related environment variables</em></a>).
 </li>
 <li>Although now segregated from the MinGW standard library
  and header components, all external library packages are still intermixed,
  one with another, in a common installation hierarchy; nonetheless,
  this is often considered to be an acceptable compromise.
 </li>
</ul></li>
<li>As a variation on option (2),
 create a separate directory hierarchy,
 for <em>each</em> and <em>every individual</em> external library package
 to be locally installed;
 this mitigates all of the disadvantages of option (1),
 and the package intermixing of option (2),
 but it incurs an alternative penalty:&ndash;
 <ul style="margin: 0.3em 0 0 -1em; list-style: disc">
 <li>As with option (2),
  appropriate <code>-I</code>&nbsp;<code><em>dir</em></code>
  and <code>-L</code>&nbsp;<code><em>dir</em></code> options
  <em>must</em> be added to each GCC invocation; however,
  whereas option (2) requires only one additional path of each type,
  this option requires an additional one of each type,
  for <em>each</em> and <em>every</em> external library to be deployed.
  (While this may still be achieved by appropriate customisation of the
  <a target="_blank" href="index.html?page=gccspecs.html#isystem"
  ><em>GCC Specs File</em></a>,
  or by appropriately specifying the
  <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
   href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Environment-Variables.html#Environment-Variables"
  ><em>CPATH and related environment variables</em></a>,
  the additional complexity, and maintenance overhead,
  may be considered unacceptable to many users).
 </li>
</ul>
</li></ol>
