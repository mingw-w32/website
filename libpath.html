<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This Mini&#8209;HOWTO further develops the theme introduced by the
&#8220;<a href="index.html?page=isystem.html"
>Include&#8197;File&#8197;Search&#8197;Path&#8197;HOWTO</a>&#8221;,
progressing to a complementary consideration of where the MinGW implementation
of GCC, (or more accurately, of the linker, <code>ld</code>, which is actually
a component of the GNU <code>binutils</code> package), searches for object
code libraries.
In particular, it address the question: &#8220;<em>How do I ensure that the
MinGW linker will find my object libraries?</em>&thinsp;&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the case of <em>header files</em>,
we observed that the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/index.html#dir">GCC Manual</a>
makes a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.5/cpp/Search-Path.html#Search-Path"
>definitive statement</a>, regarding the search path for header files,
(<em>although it became significantly less definitive,
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Search-Path.html#Search-Path"
>in the documentation for GCC&#8209;7 and later</a></em>&thinsp;),
yet we also noted that this statement is not applicable to the MinGW
implementation of GCC.  In the case of <em>libraries</em>,
the <a "noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/index.html#dir">GCC Manual</a>
makes a much <a "noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.5/gcc/Link-Options.html#Link-Options"
>less definitive statement</a>,
which is paradoxically more applicable to the MinGW implementation,
regarding the default search path:
</p>
<div class="box-out">
<code>-llibrary</code><br />
<code>-l</code>&nbsp;<code>library</code>
<p>Search the library named <code>library</code> when linking.
(The second alternative
with the <code>library</code> as a separate argument is only for POSIX compliance and
is not recommended.)
</p>
<p>It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.
Thus,
&#8216;<code>foo.o&nbsp;-lz&nbsp;bar.o</code>&#8217;
searches library &#8216;<code>z</code>&#8217; after file <code>foo.o</code>
but before <code>bar.o</code>.
If <code>bar.o</code> refers to functions in &#8216;<code>z</code>&#8217;,
those functions may
not be loaded.
</p>
<p>The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library, which is
actually a file named <code>liblibrary.a</code>.  The linker then uses this file as if it
had been specified precisely by name.
</p>
<p>The directories searched include several standard system directories plus
any that you specify with <code>-L</code>.
</p>
</div>
<p><em>Note:</em>
the second paragraph of the above extract is not strictly relevant to
the subject of this Mini&#8209;HOWTO; I&#8217;ve chosen not to elide it,
because it answers another FAQ: &#8220;<em>Why do I get undefined reference
errors, when the symbols in question are definitely present in the libraries
I&#8217;ve specified with <code>-l</code> options?</em>&thinsp;&#8221; &mdash;
the usual answer is that the <code>-l</code> options have been placed
too early in the command line argument sequence.
The remainder, and in particular the final paragraph, are pertinent,
vaguely indicating that libraries will be searched for in
<em>several standard system directories</em>;
these will be identified more explicitly in this Mini&#8209;HOWTO.

<h3>Consulting an Alternative Reference Source<br />
The GNU Binary File Utilities Manual&#8217;s Perspective</h3>
<p>We have observed that the
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/index.html#dir">GCC Manual</a>
makes no definitive statement, regarding the default directories
to be searched for libraries.
Since the actual library search is performed by the linker,
<code>ld</code>, which is a component of the <em>GNU Binary File Utilities</em>,
(more commonly known as <em>binutils</em>), we might hope to find a
more definitive statement in the
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/index.html"
>applicable section</a> of the 
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/index.html"
>Binutils Manual</a>.
Unfortunately, while obviously a useful reference for
the <em>GNU Binary File Utilities</em> in general,
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/index.html"
>this manual</a> appears to be equally noncommittal;
the only references to be found, to library search paths,
are in the
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Options.html#index-search-directory_002c-from-cmd-line-55"
>Command Line Options</a> section:
</p>
<div class="box-out">
<code>-Lsearchdir
<br />--library-path=searchdir
</code>
<p>Add path <code>searchdir</code> to the list of paths
that <code>ld</code> will search for archive
libraries and <code>ld</code> control scripts.
You may use this option any number of times.
The directories are searched in the order in which they are specified
on the command line.
Directories specified on the command line are searched
before the default directories.
All <code>-L</code> options apply to all <code>-l</code> options,
regardless of the order in which the options appear.
</p>
<p>If <code>searchdir</code> begins with <code>=</code>,
then the <code>=</code> will be replaced by the <code>sysroot</code> prefix,
a path specified when the linker is configured.
</p>
<p>The default set of paths searched (without being specified with
&#8216;<code>-L</code>&#8217;) depends
on which emulation mode <code>ld</code> is using,
and in some cases also on how it was configured.
See <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Environment.html#Environment"
>Environment</a>.
</p>
<p>The paths can also be specified in a link script with
the <code>SEARCH_DIR</code> command.
Directories specified this way are searched at the point in which the linker
script appears in the command line.
</p></div>
<p>and in the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/File-Commands.html#index-search-path-in-linker-script-334"
>Linker Scripts / File Commands</a> section:
</p>
<div class="box-out">
<code>SEARCH_DIR(path)</code>
<p>The <code>SEARCH_DIR</code> command adds path to the list of paths
where <code>ld</code> looks for archive libraries.
Using <code>SEARCH_DIR(path)</code> is exactly like using
&#8216;<code>-L</code>&nbsp;<code>path</code>&#8217;
on the command line (see <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Options.html#index-search-directory_002c-from-cmd-line-55"
>Command Line Options)</a>.
If both are used, then the linker will search both paths.
Paths specified using the command line option
are searched first.
</p></div>
<p>while the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"

<h3>Determining MinGW&#8217;s Default Library Search Path</h3>
<p>So, if the applicable manuals don&#8217;t give us any definitive
indication of which directories will be searched for libraries, how
<em>can</em> we identify where the MinGW tools will search?
</p>
<p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/index.html"
><em>ld manual</em></a> tells us that the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Options.html#index-search-directory_002c-from-cmd-line-55"
>directories searched</a> will be those specified on the command line,
using <code>-L</code> options,
followed by those specified in the effective <em>linker script</em>,
using the <code>SEARCH_DIR</code> script command.
We may identify the search directories specified within
the default <em>linker script</em>,
by running the command:
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>ld --verbose | grep SEARCH_DIR | tr -s ' ;' \\012</kbd>
</pre>
<p>which, with a standard MinGW installation,
might produce output similar to:
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>ld --verbose | grep SEARCH_DIR | tr -s ' ;' \\012</kbd>
SEARCH_DIR(&quot;/mingw/mingw32/lib&quot;)
SEARCH_DIR(&quot;/mingw/lib&quot;)
SEARCH_DIR(&quot;/usr/local/lib&quot;)
SEARCH_DIR(&quot;/lib&quot;)
SEARCH_DIR(&quot;/usr/lib&quot;)
</pre>
<p>The first thing we might notice about these
is that they are all specified in the style of POSIX paths;
however, since the MinGW tools are all native MS&#8209;Windows applications,
the linker will be unable to resolve these paths,
in any manner other than as absolute with respect to
the <em>current drive</em>,
at the time when the linker is invoked.
Thus, even if these directories do exist,
(which is unlikely in a standard MS&#8209;Windows installation),
they may represent <em>different</em> locations,
depending on whichever drive the user has made <em>current</em>,
at the time when the linker is invoked.
(For users of MSYS,
they will <em><strong>definitely not</strong></em> be resolved
relative to the root of the MSYS virtual file system,
even if that is what the user might like).
</p>
<p>Now, we have seen that none of its pre&#8209;configured search paths
seem to be particularly useful as default search paths,
for use with the MinGW linker.
That may be considered to be a configuration error,
(which a future <em>binutils</em> package release may address);
nevertheless, it does not appear to present a significant obstacle
to operation in practice,
since suitable search paths may <em>always</em> be specified
using <code>-L</code> options.  Of course,
any such options which <em><strong>we</strong></em> are required
to specify on the command line,
can hardly be described as <em><strong>default</strong></em> search paths;
however,
if we adopt the recommended practice of <em><strong>always</strong></em>
invoking <code>ld</code> via an appropriate GCC front&#8209;end,
then the GCC driver has an opportunity to supply such options,
in a manner which may be so described, and in fact,
this is precisely what happens.
</p>
<p>Thus, we have established that the linker&#8217;s
default search paths have little value, in a standard MinGW installation,
but that GCC itself furnishes the effective defaults,
by supplying appropriate <code>-L</code> options.
To discover what these default <code>-L</code> options are,
we might use the command:
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>gcc -print-search-dirs</kbd>
</pre>
<p>If we run this,
we will see a sprawling mess of nigh incomprehensible output;
some judicious filtering, to extract only the library search paths,
normalize them to canonical forms, and present them one per line,
can reduce it to a form which is more readily interpreted,
(as in this example, with an old MinGW GCC&#8209;3.4.5 system,
running under MSYS):
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>gcc -print-search-dirs | \</kbd>
&gt; <kbd>sed '/^lib/b 1;d;:1;s,/[^/.][^/]*/\.\./,/,;t 1;s,:[^=]*=,:;,;s,;,;  ,g' | \</kbd>
&gt; <kbd>tr \; \\012</kbd>
libraries:
c:/mingw/lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/
c:/mingw/lib/gcc/
/mingw/lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/
/usr/lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/
c:/mingw/mingw32/lib/mingw32/3.4.5/
c:/mingw/mingw32/lib/
/mingw/mingw32/lib/mingw32/3.4.5/
/mingw/mingw32/lib/
/mingw/lib/mingw32/3.4.5/
/mingw/lib/
c:/mingw/lib/mingw32/3.4.5/
c:/mingw/lib/
/mingw/lib/mingw32/3.4.5/
/mingw/lib/
/lib/mingw32/3.4.5/
/lib/
/usr/lib/mingw32/3.4.5/
/usr/lib/
</pre>
<p>Once again,
we may observe that this list includes a number of POSIX style paths,
which most likely are not relevant for a MinGW installation.
If we further filter, to remove the POSIX paths,
and keep only the MS&#8209;Windows style paths,
this list reduces to:
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>gcc -print-search-dirs | \</kbd>
&gt; <kbd>sed '/^lib/b 1;d;:1;s,/[^/.][^/]*/\.\./,/,;t 1;s,:[^=]*=,:;,;s,;,;  ,g' | \</kbd>
&gt; <kbd>tr \; \\012 | \</kbd>
&gt; <kbd>grep -v '^ */'</kbd>
libraries:
c:/mingw/lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/
c:/mingw/lib/gcc/
c:/mingw/mingw32/lib/mingw32/3.4.5/
c:/mingw/mingw32/lib/
c:/mingw/lib/mingw32/3.4.5/
c:/mingw/lib/
</pre>
<p>From this,
we might deduce that GCC will pass each of these paths to the linker,
using an appropriate <code>-L</code> option; to verify that deduction,
we might use GCC&#8217;s <code>-###</code> option,
in a command such as:
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
gcc -### -o foo foo.c
</pre>
<p>to reveal <em>exactly</em> what command GCC will pass to the linker; (again, the output is not formatted for easy reading, but some judicious filtering will extract just the <code>-L</code> options, and present them in a form which can be more easily read by humans):
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>touch foo.c</kbd>
$ <kbd>gcc -### -o foo foo.c 2&gt;&amp;1 | \</kbd>
&gt; <kbd>tr -s \\040 \\012 | \</kbd>
&gt; <kbd>sed '/^&quot;-L/!d;s,,,;s,&quot;$,/,;:1;s,/[^/.][^/]*/\.\./,/,;t 1' | \</kbd>
&gt; <kbd>sed 's,^,  ,;1h;1s,.*,libraries:,;1G'</kbd>
libraries:
c:/mingw/lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/
c:/mingw/lib/gcc/
c:/mingw/mingw32/lib/
c:/mingw/lib/
</pre>
<p>Oops!  What happened there?  In these examples,
GCC&#8217;s <code>&#8209;print&#8209;search&#8209;dirs</code>
option tells us that there are <em>six</em> MS&#8209;Windows paths
it will search, but <em>only four</em> of those are passed on
to the linker, as <code>-L</code> options.
Why are all six not passed on?
</p>
<p>Well,
recall that we arbitrarily chose to ignore
the POSIX style paths in GCC&#8217;s built&#8209;in list,
when we formulated the list of MS&#8209;Windows paths we expected
to be searched, but why would GCC itself make such an arbitrary choice?
In reality, it doesn&#8217;t.
Let&#8217;s re&#8209;examine that full list of built&#8209;in paths,
but this time we will filter it on an analytical basis,
selecting only those paths which represent
actual <em>physical</em> directories
on our host machine:
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>( echo libraries:</kbd>
&gt;   <kbd>drive=`pwd -W | sed 's,:.*,,'`</kbd>
&gt;   <kbd>for dir in `gcc -print-search-dirs \</kbd>
&gt;     <kbd>| sed '/^lib/b 1;d;:1;s,/[^/.][^/]*/\.\./,/,;t 1;s,:[^=]*=,:;,' \</kbd>
&gt;     <kbd>| tr \; '\012' \</kbd>
&gt;     <kbd>| sed &quot;s,^/,$drive:/,&quot;`</kbd>
&gt;     <kbd>do test -d $dir &amp;&amp; echo &quot;  $dir&quot;</kbd>
&gt;     <kbd>done</kbd>
&gt; <kbd>)</kbd>
libraries:
c:/mingw/lib/gcc/mingw32/3.4.5/
c:/mingw/lib/gcc/
c:/mingw/mingw32/lib/
c:/mingw/lib/
</pre>
<p>which, we observe,
now exactly matches the list of <code>-L</code> options
we see passed to the linker,
when we invoke GCC with the <code>-###</code> option.
Thus, we may refine our previous deduction,
to conclude that GCC will examine its built&#8209;in
list of pre&#8209;configured library search directories,
passing on to the linker, in the form of <code>-L</code> options,
those which represent actual physical directories on the host machine;
therefore, this becomes the list of default library search
directories for MinGW.
</p>

<div class="overlapped" id="install">
<h3>Installation and Use of Supplementary Libraries with MinGW</h3>
<p>When a project uses only the standard core libraries,
either as provided by the MS&#8209;Windows operating system itself,
or those provided as integral components of the MinGW distribution,
the user need take no action to ensure that those libraries
will be searched at link time;
the compiler driver will take care of it automatically.
Even in cases where the project relies on <em>optional</em> libraries
supplied as standard operating system components,
and for which MinGW provides <em>import libraries</em>,
the user need do no more than specify an appropriate
<code>-l<em>NAME</em></code> option to the compiler driver,
and the library will be linked, as required.
In either of these cases,
the necessary libraries are located within the default search path,
and no particular action is required of the user,
to specify where that might be.
</p>
<p>Conversely,
when a project supplements the standard libraries,
with one or more which it creates exclusively for its own use,
then those libraries will <em>not</em> be found
in the default search path,
so their location must be explicitly identified to the compiler driver,
to ensure that they can be found at link time.
In such cases,
in which the libraries are not installed for use by other projects,
the most common, and indeed the expected practice,
is for the project maintainer to specify the library locations explicitly,
by addition of appropriate <code>-L</code> options to the linking commands
within the project&#8217;s build system infrastructure.
When this is done correctly,
there is again no action required of the user,
to specify the location of such supplementary libraries.
</p>
<p>The situation becomes much more interesting,
when a project provides one or more supplementary libraries
for use by <em>other</em> projects.
In such cases,
there is an expectation that the libraries will be <em>installed</em>
in some central location,
whence they will become readily accessible
when <em>client</em> projects are linked,
<em>without</em> a need for any particular intervention by
the user building the client project,
to specify that location.
</p>
<p>On typical POSIX systems,
and in particular on those conforming to the GNU model,
it is common for the standard system libraries,
including those provided as standard components of the compiler suite,
to be installed in /<em>lib</em> or /<em>usr</em>/<em>lib</em>,
while supplementary libraries may be installed in
/<em>usr</em>/<em>local</em>/<em>lib</em>.
In fact, as we have already observed,
these three locations are already included,
by means of <code>SEARCH_DIR(&quot;...&quot;)</code> commands
in the default linker scripts,
as defaults to be searched by the MinGW linker;
unfortunately, they are specified exactly as such,
in the original POSIX format,
which cannot be readily interpreted in the file system context
in which the MinGW linker must operate!
This is a limitation of the MinGW linker,
which the user installing supplementary libraries must work around,
possibly by adopting one of the following strategies:&ndash;
</p>
<ol style="margin-left: -0.3em; list-style: lower-alpha">
<li>Install in a <em>non&#8209;default</em> location,
and require every user of the installed libraries to explicitly
add the requisite <code>-L</code> options to the linking commands,
for <em>every</em> subsequent project which requires any supplementary library.
This is inconvenient for subsequent use,
and is generally not recommended.
</li>
<li>Install in a location
which is already considered to be a default by the compiler driver.
This often recommended option is the simplest possible,
for <em>both</em> the user installing the libraries,
<em>and</em> for those using them.
If using MSYS as the command line environment
for building and installing the libraries,
and the libraries themselves are delivered as GNU standard source packages,
such installation may be readily accomplished by the command sequence:
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>../path/to/configure --prefix=`cd /mingw ; pwd -W` ... &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</kbd>
</pre>
<p>(Note:
here we explicitly force the use of MS&#8209;Windows <em>native</em>
path format for the <em>prefix</em>; this is normally necessary,
if the libraries being built hard code
the <em>prefix</em> within object files).
</p>
<p>It may be noted that,
in this example, we appear to have arbitrarily chosen the
top level <em>lib</em> sub&#8209;directory,
within MinGW&#8217;s own installation directory,
as the preferred location for installation of supplementary libraries;
in reality, of the pre&#8209;existing default search directories,
this is the only sane choice,
since the others are much more specifically associated with
the component libraries provided by the compiler suite itself,
and it is undesirable to pollute them with &#8220;foreign&#8221; libraries.
Indeed, many users also consider it undesirable to pollute the top level
MinGW library directory with such &#8220;foreign&#8221; libraries;
such users may prefer the following alternative installation strategy.
</p></li>
<li>Install in a <em>non&#8209;default</em> location,
just as in the first option, but also customize the <em>linker scripts</em>,
or the <em>compiler driver specs</em>,
to <em>implicitly</em> add the requisite <code>-L</code> option,
such that this location becomes an additional default search path.
Available techniques for achieving such customization will be discussed,
in the following section.
</li>
</ol>
</div><!-- install -->

<div class="overlapped" id="customize">
<h3>Customizing MinGW&#8217;s Default Library Search Path</h3>
<p>So, you&#8217;ve decided you would prefer to segregate
your add&#8209;on libraries from the core MinGW libraries?
The first issue to address,
is <em>where</em> you would like to install them.
</p>
<p>Here, you have two basic options:
<ol style="margin-left: -0.3em; list-style: lower-alpha">
<li>Establish a set up,
analogous to the common /<em>usr</em>/<em>local</em> hierarchy
of typical Unix systems, with all additional libraries,
and their associated header files, collected into this one location.
</li>
<li>Provide a separate directory for each individual library package,
and customize the GCC search paths to consider <em>all</em> of them,
as appropriate, when looking for libraries and header files.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>It should be fairly obvious that
the first of these will require less GCC customization than the second.
In fact, the principles are the same in both cases;
however, whereas the first requires the addition of only one include path,
(<code>-I</code> option), and one library path, (<code>-L</code> option),
the second will require one of each per library package installed,
which may be detrimental to GCC performance.
Thus, we will describe only the first option in detail;
users preferring the second may extend the principles described,
as necessary, to accommodate their preference.
</p>
<p>Having chosen to install all add&#8209;on libraries in a common location,
the choice of that location is fairly arbitrary.
MSYS users may choose to simply use the conceptual /<em>usr</em>/<em>local</em>
of their existing MSYS installation, in which case,
they must ensure that that directory physically exists,
(it may not in a bare, standard MSYS installation),
and they must identify its true <em><strong>native</strong></em> Windows path,
for use in the GCC customization, as shown in the following example,
for a <em><strong>standard</strong></em> MSYS installation in its
<em><strong>default</strong></em> installation directory:
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/local</kbd>
$ <kbd>( cd /usr/local &amp;&amp; pwd -W )</kbd>
c:/msys/1.0/local
</pre>
<p><em><strong>Caution:</strong>
Although this choice of directory may seem attractive,
particularly because it matches the default prefix assumed by
the majority of GNU packages,
it may <strong>not</strong> represent the <strong>best</strong> choice
for all MSYS users.
This is particularly true for those users
who may wish to develop MSYS applications.
The special MSYS build of <strong>GCC</strong>
used to compile such applications reserves </em>/usr/local<em>
for its own purposes;
in this case,
it <strong>must not</strong> be polluted by headers and libraries
intended for use with the MinGW build of <strong>GCC</strong>.</em>
</p>
<p>Alternatively,
masochists who prefer to persist with <code>cmd.exe</code>,
or MSYS users who prefer to keep MinGW related add&#8209;ons more
closely associated with their MinGW installations,
might choose to create an installation directory
locally within their MinGW tree:
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
C:\&gt; <kbd>mkdir c:\mingw\local</kbd>
</pre>
<p>or adjacent to it:
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
C:\&gt; <kbd>mkdir c:\mingw-local</kbd>
</pre>
<p><em><strong>Caution:</strong>
Whichever of these options you choose,
<strong>please do not</strong> choose to create <strong>any directory
with white space</strong> appearing <strong>anywhere</strong> in
its absolute path name.
If you adopt this asinine practice,
do not be surprised if it turns around and bites.
When it does, please <strong>do not</strong> come here to complain;
you have been warned!</em>
</p>
<p>Once the tree into which supplementary libraries,
and their headers, are to be installed has been selected,
and created, the next step is to install the requisite
library packages into this tree.
In the case of standard GNU library packages,
and assuming you have chosen <em>C:\MinGW\local</em> as your
supplementary installation path,
(MSYS users may refer to it simply as <em>/mingw/local</em>),
this may be accomplished from the MSYS shell, by running:
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>../path/to/configure --prefix=/mingw/local ... &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</kbd>
</pre>
<p>(or, if you suspect that the library may hard code
its installation path within itself):
</p>
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>../path/to/configure --prefix=`cd /mingw/local ; pwd -W` ... &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</kbd>
</pre>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong>
If the library package is <strong>not</strong> a standard GNU package,
you will need to adapt its installation procedure to achieve the effect
of the above.
Details of how this may be achieved are package specific,
and are beyond the scope of this HOWTO.</em>
</p>
<p>Finally,
having installed supplementary libraries and their headers
into the supplementary directory tree,
they must be made available to the GCC compilers.
Of course,
this may <em><strong>always</strong></em> be achieved by adding
appropriate <code>-I</code>&nbsp;<code>...</code>,
and <code>-L</code>&nbsp;<code>...</code> specifications to the commands,
when the compilers are invoked,
but that hardly seems consistent with the level of convenience
we are striving to achieve!
Obviously, the desired objective can best be met if it can be arranged
for the compilers to search in the supplementary tree by default;
this may be achieved by adding the path name for the supplementary
include file tree to the compilers&#8217; default search paths,
as described in the
&#8220;<a href="index.html?page=isystem.html">Include Path HOWTO</a>&#8221;,
accompanied by <em>either</em> of:
</p>
<ol style="margin-left: -0.3em; list-style: lower-alpha">
<li>Adding the path name for the supplementary library directory to
the <em>semicolon</em> separated list of library search directories specified
by the <code>LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable,
(which <em><strong>must</strong></em> be <em><strong>exported</strong></em>,
if it is assigned from within the MSYS shell):
<pre class="vt box-out">
$ <kbd>export LIBRARY_PATH</kbd>
$ <kbd>LIBRARY_PATH="C:/mingw/local/lib;$LIBRARY_PATH"</kbd>
</pre>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong>
The GCC manual states that this technique may be used
<strong>only</strong>
when GCC is configured as a <strong>native</strong> compiler;
thus, this method of specifying the supplementary library path
may not be used when your MinGW GCC is configured as a cross&#8209;compiler.
Indeed, it would be illogical to use this technique with a cross&#8209;compiler,
as it would lead to confusion between those libraries which are specific
to the native GCC compiler on the build platform,
and those which are specific to the cross&#8209;compiler.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>Follow the method,
as described in the
&#8220;<a href="index.html?page=gccspecs.html">GCC Customization HOWTO</a>&#8221;,
to add a supplementary path to the default library search path.
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong>
This method is applicable <strong>equally</strong> to MinGW GCC
configured as a native compiler <strong>or</strong> configured as
a cross&#8209;compiler;
the additional search path applies <strong>only</strong> to
the specific instance of the compiler
with which the modified specs file is associated</em>.
