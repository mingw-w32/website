<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This Mini&#8209;HOWTO offers advice on installation,
and explains the conventions which have been adopted by MinGW,
(and also by Cygwin),
to identify disparate versions of similarly named shared libraries, (DLLs),
and so mitigate the &#8220;DLL Hell&#8221; which may arise,
as a result of software dependencies on potentially
incompatible versions of such DLLs.

<h3>How the MS&#8209;Windows Dynamic Linker Resolves Shared Library References</h3>
<p>When a <em>PE</em>&hairsp; file,
(typically, but not restricted to,
an <em>executable</em>&hairsp;
&#8216;<em><code>*.exe</code></em>&hairsp;&#8217;,
or a <em>shared library</em>&hairsp;
&#8216;<em><code>*.dll</code></em>&hairsp;&#8217;
file), is created, the <em>build&#8209;time</em>&hairsp; linker,
(e.g.&nbsp;the MinGW linker ... <em>not</em>&hairsp;
the <em>dynamic linker</em><span class="nowrap">&hairsp;),</span>
embeds references, within the <em>PE</em>&hairsp; file itself,
to any shared libraries on which it depends.
Each such reference takes the form of just a DLL file name,
<em>without</em>&hairsp; any directory path name qualification,
and there is no direct analogue for the <em>ELF</em>&thinsp;
<span class="nowrap">&#8216;<em><code>rpath</code></em>&thinsp;&#8217;</span>
feature.
</p>
<p>When the Windows <em>dynamic linker</em>&hairsp; creates a new process image,
it first loads the <em>PE</em>&hairsp; executable program file into memory.
It then attempts to load each shared library,
named as a DLL reference within the <em>PE</em>&hairsp; file,
(and iteratively,
any further named DLL references within the loaded DLLs themselves),
mapping each one into the process address space,
and resolving symbol references across DLL boundaries;
only after all named DLLs have been loaded,
and all symbol references successfully resolved,
will execution of the process commence.
</p>
<p>To locate each DLL, named in <em>PE</em>&hairsp; file references,
the MS&#8209;Windows <em>dynamic linker</em> will search
in each of the following directories, in turn;
(this search will continue, through the directory sequence,
only as far as is necessary to locate the <em>first</em>&hairsp;
DLL file, with a name which matches the reference):
</p><ol>
<li>The directory from which the executable file, itself, was loaded.
</li>
<li>The current working directory, at process start&#8209;up time.
</li>
<li>The Windows system directory;
the path name for this directory may be identified,
by calling the <code>GetSystemDirectory()</code> function.
</li>
<li>The Windows directory;
the path name for this directory may be identified,
by calling the <code>GetWindowsDirectory()</code> function.
</li>
<li>The sequence of directories, taken in turn,
listed in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable;
(note that this is the path searched for executables themselves;
the <code>LIBPATH</code> environment variable is <em>not</em> considered,
and <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> &mdash; a standard environment variable
which is commonly associated with <em>ELF</em>&hairsp; shared libraries &mdash;
has no defined purpose in the MS&#8209;Windows environment).
</li></ol>
<p>Note that each uniquely named DLL file,
irrespective of the directory path from whence it is loaded,
will be mapped into the process address space only once.
Furthermore, if the instance of each named DLL,
which is located first in the above directory search sequence,
fails to resolve all <em>entry points</em>&hairsp;
which it is expected to provide,
process execution will fail;
the search will <em>not</em>&hairsp; be resumed,
even if a similarly named DLL file,
from a later directory in the search sequence,
may be an alternative version,
from which the missing <em>entry points</em>&hairsp;
could have been resolved.
</p>
<p>It is important to ensure that,
if an application requires a particular version of any DLL,
that the correct DLL is installed in a location whence it will be identified
early in the preceding search sequence.
In a conventional MinGW installation,
(typically in <code>C:\MinGW</code>),
this is normally achieved by installation of <em>both</em>&hairsp;
the <code>*.exe</code> files, <em>and</em>&hairsp; their associated DLLs,
in the common <code>C:\MinGW\bin</code> directory,
so that DLL identification is completed in accordance with rule (1), above.
</p>
<p>Alternatively,
for any application whose <code>*.exe</code> files are <em>not</em>&hairsp;
installed in the <code>C:\MinGW\bin</code> directory,
(since <code>C:\MinGW\bin</code> will typically be listed within
the user&#8217;s <code>PATH</code> environment variable),
MinGW DLLs may be identified in accordance with rule (5).
When applications depend on this DLL identification stratagem,
it is <em>strongly</em>&hairsp; recommended that <em>all</em>&hairsp;
MinGW DLLs be kept fully up to date,
to ensure that compatibility is maintained,
as explained below,
for <em>all</em>&hairsp; dependent applications,
regardless of age.

<h3>How MinGW Shared Library Version Numbers are Assigned</h3>
<p>The single value,
as assigned as a MinGW shared library version number,
is derived from an effective GNU libtool <em>current:revision:age</em> triplet,
which itself, is managed in accordance with the convention described in
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Libtool-versioning.html#Libtool-versioning"
>libtool&#8209;versioning section of the GNU libtool manual</a>:
</p>
<div class="box-out">
<p>[...] libtool library versions are described by three integers:
</p>
<dl class="hanging-indent" style="margin-top: 0.2em">
<dt>current</dt>
<dd>The most recent interface [<em>ABI</em> version] number
that this library implements.
</dd>
<dt>revision</dt>
<dd>The implementation [revision] number of
the <em><code>current</code></em>&hairsp; interface.
</dd>
<dt>age</dt>
<dd>The difference between [the <em>ABI</em> version numbers of]
the newest and oldest interfaces that this library implements.
In other words,
the library implements all the interface numbers in the range from number
<em><code>current</code>&thinsp;<code>-</code>&thinsp;<code>age</code></em>&hairsp;
to <em><code>current</code></em>.
</dd></dl>
</div><!-- box-out -->
<p>These <em><code>current:revision:age</code></em> attributes are assigned,
by the maintainer of the library,
as specified in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html#Updating-version-info"
>the immediately following section of the GNU libtool manual</a>:
</p>
<div class="box-out">
<p>Here are a set of rules to help you update your library version information:
</p><ol>
<li>Start with version information of &#8216;<code>0:0:0</code>&#8217;
for each libtool library.
</li>
<li>Update the version information only immediately before a public release
of your software. More frequent updates are unnecessary, and only guarantee
that the current interface number gets larger faster.
</li>
<li>If the library source code has changed at all,
since the [version information was last updated],
then increment <em><code>revision</code></em>&hairsp; <span class="nowrap">(i.e. 
&#8216;<em><code>current:revision:age</code></em>&hairsp;&#8217;</span> becomes
&#8216;<span class="nowrap"><em><code>current:revision</code></em>&thinsp;<!--
--><code>+</code>&hairsp;<code>1<em>:age</em></code>&hairsp;&#8217;<!--
-->&hairsp;).</span>
</li>
<li>If any interfaces have been added, removed,
or changed since the last update,
increment <em><code>current</code></em>,
and set <em><code>revision</code></em>&hairsp; to <code>0</code>.
</li>
<li>If any interfaces [i.e.&nbsp;<em>entry points</em>&hairsp;]
have been added since the last public release,
then increment <em><code>age</code></em>.
</li>
<li>If any interfaces [i.e.&nbsp;<em>entry points</em>&hairsp;] have been removed,
or [the <em>data type</em> or <em>function prototype</em>
of any <em>entry point</em> has been] changed since the last public release,
then set <em><code>age</code></em>&hairsp; to <code>0</code>. 
</li></ol>
<p><em><strong>Never</strong></em> try to set the interface numbers
so that they correspond to the release number of your package.
This is an abuse that only fosters misunderstanding of
the purpose of library versions. [...]
</p>
<p>The following explanation
may help [you] to understand the above rules a bit better:
consider that there are three possible kinds of reactions
from users of your library to changes in a shared library:
</p><ol>
<li>Programs using the previous version
may use the new version as drop-in replacement,
and programs using the new version can also work with the previous one.
In other words, no recompiling nor relinking is needed.
In this case, bump <em><code>revision</code></em>&hairsp; only,
don&#8217;t touch <em><code>current</code></em>&hairsp;
[or] <em><code>age</code></em>.
</li>
<li>Programs using the previous version
may use the new version as drop-in replacement,
but programs using the new version may use <em>APIs</em>
[which are] not present in the previous one.
In other words, a program linking against the new version
may fail with &#8220;unresolved symbols&#8221;
if [deployed with] the old version at runtime:
set <em><code>revision</code></em>&hairsp; to <code>0</code>,
bump [i.e. increment both] <em><code>current</code></em>&hairsp;
and <em><code>age</code></em>.
</li>
<li>Programs may need to be changed,
recompiled, and relinked in order to use the new version.
Bump <em><code>current</code></em>,
set [both] <em><code>revision</code></em>&hairsp;
and <em><code>age</code></em>&hairsp; to <code>0</code>. 
</li></ol>
<p>In the above description,
<em>programs</em> using the library in question may also be
replaced by other libraries using it.
</p>
</div><!-- box-out -->
<p>To derive the single&#8209;valued MinGW shared library version number,
from the GNU libtool compatible
<em><code>current:revision:age</code></em>&hairsp; triplet,
we adopt the convention originally suggested by Gary Vaughan,
in a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin/2000-September/040213.html"
>posting to the Cygwin mailing&#8209;list</a>,
to the effect that the effective shared library version should be
set equal to the version number of the <em>oldest ABI</em>&hairsp; version
supported by the shared library;
this is equivalent to the result of the calculation
<em><code>current</code>&thinsp;<code>-</code>&thinsp;<code>age</code></em>,
taking the individual values of <em><code>current</code></em>,
and <em><code>age</code></em>&hairsp; from the libtool triplet.
(Note that this does <em>not require</em>&hairsp; use of libtool
for maintanence of the shared library;
it is sufficient to adopt the libtool numbering convention,
and to calculate
<em><code>current</code>&thinsp;<code>-</code>&thinsp;<code>age</code></em>&hairsp;
manually).

<div class="overlapped" id="explanation">
<h3>Evolution of MinGW Shared Library Versions</h3>
<p>To further illustrate the evolution of MinGW shared library versions,
let us consider the development life&#8209;cycle of
a hypothetical library, <code>libfoo.dll</code>,
for which the most recent release corresponds to a GNU libtool
<em><code>current:revision:age</code></em>&hairsp; triplet
of <code>5:4:3</code>;
this indicates that the <em>current ABI</em>&hairsp; version of
this hypothetical library is <code>5</code>,
and that this version is fully <em>backwardly compatible</em>&hairsp; with
each of the <em>three</em>&hairsp; preceding releases,
with <em>ABI</em>&hairsp; version numbers <code>4</code>,
<code>3</code>, and <code>2</code>;
thus, the MinGW library version,
computed as <em><code>current</code>&thinsp;<code>-</code>&thinsp;<code>age</code></em>,
will be <code>2</code>,
yielding a versioned library name of <code>libfoo-2.dll</code>;
it may be observed that this version&#8209;indicating name corresponds to
the <em>oldest ABI</em>&hairsp; version which is fully compatible with
the <em>current ABI</em>&hairsp; version <code>5</code> release.
</p>
<p>There are many evolutionary paths,
which <code>libfoo&#8209;2.dll</code> may have followed,
to become the equivalent of a libtool&#8209;managed <code>5:4:3</code> release;
the following example represents just one such possible path:
</p><ol>
<li>Regardless of the path followed,
the starting point is <em>always</em> equivalent to
libtool release <code>0:0:0</code>, yielding a computed
<em><code>current</code>&thinsp;<code>-</code>&thinsp;<code>age</code></em>&hairsp;
value of <code>0</code>&thinsp;<code>-</code>&thinsp;<code>0</code>,
(or simply <code>0</code>);
thus, the MinGW designation for the <em>initial</em> release
will be <code>libfoo&#8209;0.dll</code>.
</li>
<li>The library goes through several release cycles,
without any change in, addition to,
or removal from its public <em>interface</em>&hairsp;;
the libtool <em><code>revision</code></em>&hairsp; is incremented,
at each release,
through <code>0:1:0</code>,&thinsp;<code>0:2:0</code>,&thinsp;<code>...</code>,
but, since neither <em><code>current</code></em>,
nor <em><code>age</code></em>&hairsp; is changed,
the MinGW release designation remains as <code>libfoo&#8209;0.dll</code>.
<p>This is correct,
because the <em>interface</em>&hairsp; remains unchanged from
the <em>initial</em>&hairsp; release;
programs linked against the initial release may continue to use
this <code>libfoo&#8209;0.dll</code>,
as a drop&#8209;in replacement for the original,
while benefitting from any bug&#8209;fixes
which may have been applied in the newer releases.
</p></li>
<li>Following the release of <code>libfoo&#8209;0.dll</code>,
corresponding to (say) libtool release <code>0:4:0</code>,
a new function <em>entry point</em>&hairsp; is added,
<em>without</em>&hairsp; changing the established interface
<em>in any way</em>.
This introduces a <em>forwardly incompatible</em>&hairsp;
change in the <em>API</em>,&hairsp; (because any new application
which depends on the new <em>entry point</em>&hairsp; will be
incompatible with any earlier release of <code>libfoo&#8209;0.dll</code>);
however, the <em>API</em>&hairsp; remains <em>backwardly compatible</em>&hairsp;
with previous releases, (because <em>none</em>&hairsp; of the
previously existing <em>entry points</em>&hairsp; exhibit
any change in behaviour).
<p>To reflect this change in compatibility,
the libtool <em><code>current</code></em>&hairsp; version number
is incremented,
while resetting the <em><code>revision</code></em>&hairsp;
to <code>0</code>,
(to account for the addition of the new <em>entry point</em>&hairsp;);
at the same time, <em><code>age</code></em>&hairsp;
is incremented in lock&#8209;step,
(because <em>backward</em>&hairsp; compatibility,
with the preceding release, is preserved).
Consequently, the libtool release identification becomes <code>1:0:1</code>,
since the result of computing
<em><code>current</code>&thinsp;<code>-</code>&thinsp;<code>age</code></em>,
(which now becomes <code>1</code>&thinsp;<code>-</code>&thinsp;<code>1</code>),
remains equal to <code>0</code>, and thus,
the MinGW library designation remains as
<code>libfoo&#8209;0.dll</code>.
Once again, this is correct; in spite of the change
in libtool <em><code>current</code></em>&hairsp; release number,
the <em>oldest</em>&hairsp; value of <em><code>current</code></em>&hairsp;
release, with which this release remains <em>backwardly</em>&hairsp; compatible,
is still <code>0</code>.
</p></li>
<li>After the release of <code>libfoo&#8209;0.dll</code>,
at libtool release point <code>1:0:1</code>,
one of the publicly visible <em>entry point</em>&hairsp; functions
is deemed to have become obsolete, and is removed.
This represents another change to the public <em>interface</em>,
so once again the libtool <em><code>current</code></em>&hairsp;
release number must be incremented,
and the <em><code>revision</code></em>&hairsp; reset;
however, this is <em>not</em>&hairsp; a <em>backwardly
compatible</em>&hairsp; change, so, for this release,
<em><code>age</code></em>&hairsp; is reset to <code>0</code>,
rather than being incremented.
The effect of this is that the libtool release number advances
to <code>2:0:0</code>, and the MinGW release number, computed as
<em><code>current</code>&thinsp;<code>-</code>&thinsp;<code>age</code></em>,
advances to <code>2</code>, resulting in a new MinGW library designation
of <code>libfoo&#8209;2.dll</code>.
<p>Note that this is, once again, correct:
the libtool <em><code>current</code></em>&hairsp; release number has advanced,
to <code>2</code>; this release is no longer <em>backwardly</em>&hairsp;
compatible with any other release, older than itself,
and the MinGW release number has also advanced accordingly;
this <code>libfoo&#8209;2.dll</code> is <em>not</em>&hairsp; suitable for
use as a drop&#8209;in replacement for <code>libfoo&#8209;0.dll</code>,
and the DLL file name has been changed, to prevent any such misuse.
</p></li>
<li>The next few release cycles,
following the preceding release of <code>libfoo&#8209;2.dll</code>,
may proceed as described in (2), above, thus requiring only
the libtool <em><code>revision</code></em>&hairsp; to be incremented,
<em>without</em>&hairsp; affecting the MinGW release number,
<em>in any way</em>.
These may be interspersed with three further cycles,
similar to that described in (3), above,
in which any number of new <em>entry points</em>&hairsp; are added,
but <em>none</em>&hairsp; are removed or modified;
after the third such type (3) release,
the libtool release number will have advanced through
<code>3:0:1</code>, <code>4:0:2</code>, and finally <code>5:0:3</code>.
If this is then followed by by four further type (2) releases,
there will be four further increments in
the libtool <em><code>revision</code></em>,
ultimately advancing the libtool release number to <code>5:4:3</code>;
at this stage in the release cycle sequence, the
<em><code>current</code>&thinsp;<code>-</code>&thinsp;<code>age</code></em>&hairsp;
computation will continue to yield a MinGW release number of <code>2</code>,
and the MinGW library will continue to be named <code>libfoo&#8209;2.dll</code>.
</li></ol>
<p>It may be observed that,
following the preceding sequence of release cycles,
whereas the libtool release number is able to convey the information that
the current library version implements revision <code>4</code> of
the implementation of version <code>5</code> of the <em>interface</em>,
and that this implementation is fully <em>backwardly compatible</em>&hairsp;
with version <code>2</code> of this interface,
the MinGW release number cannot adequately convey any more than
the last of these pieces of information.
Although this limitation may appear to be problematic,
in practice it isn&#8217;t, <em>provided</em>&hairsp; the installed
version of <code>libfoo&#8209;2.dll</code> is its most recently
released distribution;
unlike <em>ELF dynamic linkers</em>,
the <em>PE dynamic linker</em>&hairsp; simply isn&#8217;t smart enough
to select a DLL on the basis of a <em>range</em>&hairsp; of supported
<em>interface</em>&hairsp; versions,
so the best we can hope for is that the selected library,
as named for its <em>oldest</em>&hairsp; supported version,
covers the required range;
the most effective assurance that we can have for this
is that the selected library is the most recently released distribution,
with the specified name.

<div class="overlapped" id="conclusion">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>&#8220;DLL Hell&#8221; arises
when two identically named shared library files provide different
(incompatible) <em>APIs</em>&hairsp; ... perhaps even incompatible versions
of fundamentally the same <em>API</em>&hairsp;;
a common cause is that installation of some third&#8209;party software
product has overwritten an installed DLL file with an obsolete version.
</p>
<p>Sometimes,
a particular software product requires a particular version of
a specific DLL, with which the most recent version of that DLL is
<em>not backwardly compatible</em>,&hairsp; (because the developer
of that DLL may not have exercised good version control discipline).
To avoid this kind of issue,
MinGW has adopted a DLL version management discipline,
conforming to the following conventions:
</p><ul>
<li>Each installed MinGW DLL should include, within its file name,
a numerical indication of <em>oldest API</em>&hairsp; implementation version,
(and corresponding <em>ABI</em>&hairsp; version),
with which it remains&hairsp;<em>100% backwardly compatible</em>.
</li>
<li>Since the <em>API</em>&hairsp; version number,
which is encoded within the DLL file name,
represents the <em>oldest API implementation</em>&hairsp;
with which the DLL is 100% <em>backwardly</em>&hairsp; compatible,
newer versions may add new functionality
<em>without</em>&hairsp; requiring a change of name,
provided <em>all existing</em>&hairsp; functionality remains unchanged.
</li>
<li>If <em>API</em>&hairsp; functionality is changed,
in any way which causes a break in <em>backwards</em>&hairsp; compatibility,
the <em>API version number</em>&hairsp; indication,
which is embedded within the DLL file name,
<em>must</em>&hairsp; be incremented,
(by at least one, but it may be by more),
resulting in a corresponding change in the DLL file name.
</li>
<li>In the event that any MinGW DLL is published, <em>without</em>&hairsp;
embedding an <em>API version number</em>&hairsp; in the file name,
then the most recent release of this DLL <em>must</em>&hairsp; be
<em>backwardly compatible</em>&hairsp; with <em>every</em>&hairsp;
previous release of any MinGW DLL with the same name.
</li></ul>
<p>Adoption of these conventions ensures that,
if the most recent release of each, and every required MinGW DLL is installed,
at an appropriate location within the DLL directory search path,
then, on account of the promise of <em>backwards compatibility</em>,&hairsp;
applications which are dependent on any releases of these DLLs
will continue to operate as intended.
Additionally, it allows releases of mutually incompatible,
similarly named (but for the version identifier) DLLs to co&#8209;exist,
within the DLL search path,
thus ensuring that applications which may depend on older,
incompatible DLL versions,
may continue to operate correctly.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the conventions alone <em>cannot</em>&hairsp;
prevent any user, or third&#8209;party package installer,
from replacing the most recent MinGW release of any DLL with an older release,
(or with an incompatible third&#8209;party DLL with the same name).
Since <em>forward compatibility</em>&hairsp; is <em>never</em>&hairsp; promised,
for an older MinGW DLL release used in conjunction with an application
which may be dependent on a more recent release,
(nor is there <em>any</em>&hairsp; expectation of <em>any form of
compatibility</em>&hairsp; from <em>any</em>&hairsp; third&#8209;party DLL),
it becomes incumbent upon the user,
to ensure that <em>only</em>&hairsp; the most recent
releases of MinGW DLLs are (and remain) installed.
