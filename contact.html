<p>If you have exhausted all of the web&#8209;site resources,
and you have searched all of the
<a href="index.html?page=mailing.html"
>available mailing&#8209;list archives</a>,
and all of the on&#8209;line
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/ticket/"
>bug report and feature request tickets</a>,
then you may wish to contact MinGW.OSDN for assistance.
Please refer to the relevant sections below,
for guidance on <a href="#general-enquiry">making general enquiries</a>,
on <a href="#bug-report">filing bug reports</a>,
or on <a href="#feature-request">requesting new features</a>.
</p>
<p><em>Please note:
the mingw&#8209;w64 and MSYS2 projects are <strong>not</strong>,
in any way, affiliated with MinGW.OSDN;
MinGW.OSDN <strong>does not</strong> support the products
of these projects.</em>

<div class="overlapped" id="general-enquiry">
<h3>General Enquiries</h3>
<p>If you encounter a problem using MinGW, or MSYS,
and you cannot find a satisfactory answer on our web&#8209;site,
in our
<a href="index.html?page=mailing.html">mailing&#8209;list archives</a>,
or elsewhere on the internet,
or if you simply need some advice relating to MinGW, or MSYS,
then we advise you to
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://lists.osdn.me/mailman/listinfo/mingw-users"
>subscribe to the MinGW&#8209;Users mailing&#8209;list</a>,
and ask.
</p>
<p><em>Do please note that, to help avoid spam,
this mailing&#8209;list is open to subscribers only.
Please <strong>do not</strong>
attempt to circumvent the subscription process,
by sending mail to either the mingw-users-owner,
or the mingw-users-admin addresses.
Doing so will be of no benefit to you,
since subscription is free&#8209;of&#8209;charge in any case,
and you will get no reply from the former address,
while the latter is reserved for automated self&#8209;help replies,
in response to specific subject keywords.</em>
</p>
<p>Before posting to this mailing&#8209;list,
we <em>strongly</em> recommend that you acquaint yourself with
<a href="index.html?page=mailing.html#list-etiquette"
>the mailing&#8209;list posting etiquette</a>;
compliance with this may improve your chances of receiving a response,
whereas non&#8209;compliance may result in your post being ignored.

<h3>Reporting Bugs</h3>
<p>After discussing an issue on the mailing&#8209;list,
as described above, you may be asked to file a formal bug report.
(Alternatively,
if you are certain that you have identified a bug in a MinGW.OSDN product,
you may choose to file such a bug report of your own volition;
however, if you choose this course of action,
please be aware that many bug reports,
which are filed <em>without</em> prior discussion,
are ultimately dismissed as user error).
</p>
<p><em>Before you even consider filing a bug report,
please review
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/ticket/"
>the list of existing tickets</a>,
(<strong>including closed tickets</strong>
&mdash; ensure that the &#8220;Open&#8221; and &#8220;Closed&#8221;
status check&#8209;boxes are <strong>both</strong> selected,
and click the &#8220;Search&#8221; button),
to ensure that the issue has not already been reported</em>.
</p>
<p><em>Please <strong>do not</strong> file a bug report,
if your issue relates to an unimplemented API feature;
it is more appropriate to file
a &#8220;<a href="#feature-request">Feature Request</a>&#8221; instead</em>.
</p>
<p><em>Please do not waste your time, (and ours),
reporting issues with your anti&#8209;virus software;
the heuristic nature of such software, all too frequently,
results in false&#8209;positive reports,
and in the absence of deterministic evidence of infection,
we will take no action in response.</em>
</p>
<p>Regardless of your motivation for filing a bug report,
you <em>must</em>, (unless you already have one),
<em><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://osdn.net/account/register.php"
>create a personal OSDN.net account</a></em>,
and you should also
<em><a target="_blank" href="index.html?page=buginfo.html"
>acquaint yourself with the bug reporting guidelines</a></em>.
You may then
<em><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://osdn.net/account/login.php?return_to=/ticket/newticket.php?group_id=3917"
>log in to your OSDN.net account</a></em>,
and proceed to
<em><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://osdn.net/ticket/newticket.php?group_id=3917"
>the bug report submission form</a></em>.
Please review the submission instructions,
(which appear at the top of the submission form),
then complete the form,
leaving the ticket type set to &#8220;Issue&#8221;.
</p>
<p><em>Please <strong>do not</strong> ignore the submission instructions.
In particular, note that,
unless you are a member of the MinGW.OSDN Project development team,
you are <strong>not</strong> authorized to assign a specific responder
for the ticket; nor are you authorized to assign an elevated priority
or severity attribute for your ticket.
If you exceed your authority,
your ticket <strong>will</strong> be reassigned to <strong>lowest</strong>
priority/severity, and may even be rejected altogether</em>.
</p>
<p>Before you finally submit your report,
please use the &#8220;Preview&#8221; facility to check for,
and correct, any markup errors;
(these are, alas, all too common,
and create a bad impression of the reporter).
Pay particular attention to in&#8209;line program code references,
or program code examples,
(whether in&#8209;line, or multi&#8209;line code blocks);
these <em>must</em>&hairsp; be enclosed in <em>triple&#8209;brace</em>&hairsp;
mark&#8209;up, either as <em>in&#8209;line formatted text</em>,&hairsp;
or as <em>formatted text blocks</em>&hairsp;, as appropriate;
(please see <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://osdn.net/docs/WikiSyntax"
>the OSDN.net formatting guide</a>,
and be aware that the use of <em>fixed pitch</em>,&hairsp;
as introduced by <em>back&#8209;tick</em>&hairsp; mark&#8209;up,
generally <em>isn&#8217;t</em>&hairsp; a satisfactory alternative).
Finally, when you are satisfied, click the &#8220;Submit&#8221; button
to complete the ticket submission process.

<div class="overlapped" id="feature-request">
<h3>Feature Requests</h3>
<p>When you wish to request the implementation of a new feature,
(e.g.&nbsp;to support a currently unsupported MSVC or POSIX API function),
you should file a feature request ticket.
The procedure is effectively the same as that for
<a href="#bug-report">filing a bug report</a>,
<em>except</em> that you set the ticket type to &#8220;Feature Request&#8221;,
instead of leaving it as &#8220;Issue&#8221;.
</p>
<p><em>Please be aware that feature request submissions are subject
to the same restrictions on your authority,
as are applicable to <a href="#bug-report">bug reporting</a></em>.
</p>
<p>Before you submit a feature request,
it is recommended that you discuss the feasibility of implementing
the proposed feature, as a <a href="#general-enquiry">general enquiry topic</a>,
on the mailing&#8209;list.
Additionally, <em>after</em> you have submitted such a request,
you should use the mailing&#8209;list to bring it to the
attention of the MinGW user community,
and invite them to support your request,
by <em>voting</em> on your ticket;
(please note that MinGW developers will consider votes,
when prioritizing feature requests).
