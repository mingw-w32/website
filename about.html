<p><strong>MinGW</strong>,
a contraction of &#8220;Minimalist GNU for Windows&#8221;,
is a minimalist development environment
for native Microsoft Windows applications.
</p>
<p><strong>MinGW</strong> is a registered trademark of
<a href="https://www.spi-inc.org/projects/mingw/"
>Software in the Public Interest Inc.</a>,
registration

searchType=statusSearch">number 86017856</a>;
it has been registered on behalf of MinGW.org,
and its use by any other project is unauthorized.
</p>
<p><strong>MinGW</strong>
provides a complete Open Source programming tool set which is
suitable for the development of native MS-Windows applications,
and which do not depend on any 3rd&#8209;party C&#8209;Runtime DLLs.
(It <strong><em>does</em></strong>
depend on a number of DLLs provided by Microsoft
themselves, as components of the operating system;
most notable among these is MSVCRT.DLL,
the Microsoft C runtime library.
Additionally, threaded applications <strong><em>must</em></strong>
ship with a freely distributable thread support DLL,
provided as part of MinGW itself).
</p>
<p><strong>MinGW</strong>
compilers provide access to the functionality of the
Microsoft C runtime and some language&#8209;specific runtimes.
MinGW, being Minimalist, <strong>does not, and never will, attempt to
provide a full POSIX runtime environment for POSIX application deployment
on MS&#8209;Windows</strong>.
If you want POSIX application deployment on this platform,
please consider
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> instead.
</p>
<p>Primarily intended for use by developers working on the native
MS&#8209;Windows platform,
but also available for cross&#8209;hosted use,
(<a href="#cross-compile">see note below</a>),
<strong>MinGW</strong> includes:&mdash;
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/p15691"
>A port of the GNU Compiler Collection</a>
(GCC), including C, C++, ADA and Fortran compilers;
</li>
<li><a href="https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/p15608"
>GNU Binutils for Windows</a> (assembler, linker, archive manager)
</li>
<li>A command&#8209;line installer,
with optional GUI front&#8209;end,
(<a href="https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/p15522"
>mingw&#8209;get</a>)
for MinGW and MSYS deployment on MS&#8209;Windows</li>
<li>A GUI first&#8209;time setup tool
(<a href="https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/downloads/68260/mingw-get-setup.exe/"
>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup</a>),
to get you up and running with
<a href="https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/p15522"
>mingw&#8209;get</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<div><p><strong>MSYS</strong>,
a contraction of &#8220;Minimal SYStem&#8221;,
is a Bourne Shell command line interpreter system.
Offered as an alternative to Microsoft&#8217;s cmd.exe,
this provides a general purpose command line environment,
which is particularly suited to use with <strong>MinGW</strong>,
for porting of many Open Source applications to the
MS&#8209;Windows platform;
a light&#8209;weight fork of Cygwin&#8209;1.3,
it includes a small selection of Unix tools,
chosen to facilitate that objective.

<h3 id="cross-compile">Using MinGW for Cross-Hosted Development</h3>
<p>While <strong>MinGW</strong> provides tools
primarily intended for use by developers working on the
MS&#8209;Windows platform,
many developers choose to run cross&#8209;compiler
variants of the <strong>MinGW</strong> tools,
on platforms such as GNU/Linux,
to generate applications for deployment on MS&#8209;Windows.
To facilitate this development model,
many Linux distributors provide the necessary cross-compiler tools,
derived from the <strong>MinGW</strong> tool chains;
such cross&#8209;compiler tool chains are
<strong><em>not</em></strong> directly supported by MinGW.org,
although we may be able to help out with advice related to the specifics
of MS&#8209;Windows applications development,
common to the use of our own native tool chains
and to such cross&#8209;compilers.
