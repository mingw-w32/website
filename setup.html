<p>This HOWTO document provides instructions,
and recommendations, both for first&#8209;time installation,
and subsequent maintenance of the MinGW (GCC) compiler suite,
and ancillary MinGW applications and/or tools;
the recommended method of installation is suitable
for <em>all</em>&hairsp; users,
regardless of experience,
or level of expertise.
</p>
<p><strong><em>Caution</em></strong>&hairsp;:
MinGW may have problems with paths containing spaces, and if not,
other programs used with MinGW may often experience problems with such paths.
Thus, we <strong><em>strongly recommend</em></strong>&hairsp; that you
<strong><em>do not install MinGW in any location
with spaces in the absolute path name</em></strong>&hairsp;;
you should avoid installing into any directory or subdirectory
having names like <code>&quot;Program</code>&#8197;<code>Files&quot;</code>
or <code>&quot;My</code>&#8197;<code>Documents&quot;</code>, etc.
</p>
<p>The preferred installation target directory,
its path name having been chosen to comply with the preceding recommendation,
is <code><strong>C:\MinGW</strong></code>
</p>
<p>The preferred installation method is using
the <code>mingw-get</code> &#8220;Installation Manager&#8221; tool,
<a href="#start-here">as described below</a>.
While a manual installation is possible,
we recommend it only for expert users,
unless you have a very old version of MS&#8209;Windows,
which is unable to run the GUI variant of <code>mingw&#8209;get</code>.
If you really want (or need) to resort to it,
instructions for manual installation are provided in
<a target="_blank" href="index.html?page=install.html"
>this alternative HOWTO document</a>.
</p>
<p>After installation,
you may need to perform some additional system configuration tasks yourself,
to ensure your MinGW applications will run.
Most importantly,
you may need to set up <code>Start</code>&#8197;<code>Menu</code>,
or <code>Desktop</code> &#8220;short&#8209;cuts&#8221;,
to launch a suitable command line interpreter session,
with appropriate environment variable settings,
(notably, the <code>PATH</code> setting),
for running MinGW applications;
further details may be found in the
<a href="#post-install">post&#8209;installation section</a>,
below.
</p>
<p>Ultimately,
having completed installation and configuration,
you will wish to perform occasional maintenance tasks,
perhaps to install additional packages,
and certainly to install software updates,
and so keep your installation up&#8209;to&#8209;date;
suitable maintenance procedures are discussed in
<a href="#maintenance">the final section</a>
of this document.

<h3>Setting Up the MinGW Installation Manager for First&#8209;Time Use</h3>
<p>The first step,
in the recommended procedure for creating a new MinGW installation,
is to install the <code>mingw-get</code> installer itself;
this can be most readily accomplished by downloading,
and subsequently running,
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://osdn.net/dl/mingw/mingw-get-setup.exe"
>the GUI <code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code> tool</a>.
</p>
<p>If you have previously installed <code>mingw&#8209;get</code>,
and your objective is to upgrade, or to extend,
its associated (existing) MinGW installation,
then you should <em>not</em> run <code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code> again;
you <em>should</em> simply run <code>mingw&#8209;get.exe</code>, and
<a href="#install-packages">proceed directly to the next installation phase</a>.
</p>
<p>If do wish to run <code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code>,
and you already have a local copy,
we <em>strongly</em> recommend that you check its publication date,
to ensure that it is no older than the current release,
<a rel="noopener noreferrer"
 target="_blank" href="https://osdn.net/projects/mingw"
>as identified at https://osdn.net/projects/mingw</a>;
you should <em>always</em> run the most recent release of
<code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code>,
so please download a replacement copy,
if yours is out of date.
</p>
<p>When you <em>do</em> choose to run
<code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code>,
you should follow this sequence of steps:&ndash;
</p>
<ol class="setup-steps">
<li><img src="https://static-cdn.osdn.net/thumb/g/5/213/800x600_0.png"
 alt="Installer Setup &mdash; Opening Dialogue"
/><div class="desc">
Depending on your MS&#8209;Windows version,
and its system security policy configuration,
you may be able to invoke <code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code>
directly from the <a rel="noopener noreferrer"
 target="_blank" href="https://osdn.net/dl/mingw/mingw-get-setup.exe"
>download link specified above</a>;
alternatively, you may need to save a local copy,
locate it in the file&#8209;system explorer,
and double&#8209;click to invoke it.
In either case, and again depending on Windows version,
and security policy configuration,
you may need to authorize execution of
<code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code>,
and the changes it will make to your system,
after which you should see a dialogue similar
to that depicted to the right.
<p>When you see this dialogue,
we advise you to acquaint yourself with the content
of the warranty disclaimer, and additional &#8220;blurb&#8221;,
which appears below the copyright notice;
you may also wish to review the licensing terms,
which will be displayed in a web browser window,
if you click the <code>View</code>&#8197;<code>Licence</code> button.
</p>
<p>When you are ready to proceed,
click the <code>Install</code> button to move on to the next step;
alternatively, you may click the <code>Cancel</code> button
to abandon the installation process.
</p>
</div><!-- ol.setup-steps desc -->
</li>
<div class="step-ref" id="step-1-ii"></div>
<li><img src="https://static-cdn.osdn.net/thumb/g/5/214/800x600_0.png"
 alt="Installer Setup &mdash; Preferences Dialogue"
/><div class="desc">
On progressing from the opening dialogue,
by clicking on the <code>Install</code> button
as stipulated in the preceding step,
you will be presented with a new dialogue,
as depicted to the right.
Here, you have the opportunity to select from
a set of optional configuration attributes for
your <code>mingw&#8209;get</code> installation,
and for the associated MinGW installation,
which you will use it to manage.
<p>You may observe, when this dialogue is opened,
that the installation directory is specified, by default,
to be <code>C:\MinGW</code>.
We <em>strongly</em> recommend that you leave this
at its default setting,
<em>except</em> in the particular cases where:&ndash;
<ul><li>Your system policy forbids installation into a directory
at this level within the file&#8209;system hierarchy,
and you are unable to obtain authorization for an exception
to such a policy.
</li>
<li>You require an alternative installation root directory,
for the purpose of creating <em>side&#8209;by&#8209;side</em>
MinGW sandbox installations.
</li></ul>
<p>If you do choose to change the installation directory,
you may click the <code>Change</code> button to open
a standard file&#8209;system navigation dialogue,
whence you may select, or create, an alternative directory;
<em>do</em> please heed the warning about avoiding any
directory name, which introduces white&#8209;space into
its absolute path name.
</p>
<p>Other installation options, which you may select via this dialogue,
include:&ndash;
</p>
<ul><li>Installation of the <code>mingw&#8209;get</code> GUI application,
in addition to the CLI version, (which is <em>always</em> installed).
</li>
<li>Installation of Windows &#8220;shortcuts&#8221;,
either on the desktop,
or in the Windows <code>Start</code>&nbsp;<code>Menu</code>, (or both),
for either the current user only (<em>strongly</em> recommended),
or for all users;
(if installed, these will launch the <code>mingw&#8209;get</code>
GUI client, and thus are effective only if that is installed).
</li></ul>
<p>Once you have specified your choice of installation root directory,
and completed your selection of installation options,
you may click the <code>Continue</code> button,
to proceed to the next step &mdash; the actual installation
of <code>mingw&#8209;get</code>.
</p>
</div><!-- ol.setup-steps desc -->
</li>
<li><img src="https://static-cdn.osdn.net/thumb/g/5/215/800x600_0.png"
 alt="Installer Setup &mdash; Download Dialogue"
/><div class="desc">
Your computer <em>must</em> remain actively connected to the internet,
throughout this step, which should proceed <em>without</em> user intervention.
<p>While the process proceeds, you should observe a dialogue similar to
that depicted to the right; the data displayed will be dynamically
updated, as the constituent packages of <code>mingw&#8209;get</code>
are downloaded from the MinGW.org on&#8209;line file store,
and installed locally, into your designated installation directory tree.
</p>
<p>You may observe that,
while download and installation are in progress,
the <code>Continue</code> and <code>Quit</code>
buttons are <em>disabled</em>;
they will be <em>enabled</em>, only when the process completes.
</p>
<p>If errors occur, during the download and installation process,
only the <code>Quit</code> button will be <em>enabled</em>,
allowing you to terminate <code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code>;
please <a target="_blank"
 href="index.html?page=faq.html#troubleshoot-installation"
>consult the FAQ</a>, or <a target="_blank"
 href="index.html?page=mailing.html#mingw-users"
>seek advice via the mailing list</a>,
for assistance to troubleshoot, and resolve the errors,
<em>before</em> running <code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code> again.
</p>
<p>When the download and installation of <code>mingw&#8209;get</code>
completes successfully, <em>both</em> the <code>Continue</code>,
<em>and</em> the <code>Quit</code> buttons will be <em>enabled</em>.
At this point, you may choose to:&ndash;
</p>
<ul><li>Click the <code>Continue</code> button,
to terminate <code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code>,
and <em>immediately</em> start <code>mingw&#8209;get</code> in GUI mode;
(note that the <code>mingw&#8209;get</code> GUI is available at this point,
at least temporarily, even if you chose not to install it permanently).
</li>
<li>Click the <code>Quit</code> button,
to terminate <code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code>
<em>without</em> starting <code>mingw&#8209;get</code>;
(you may resume installation of MinGW later,
by running stand&#8209;alone <code>mingw&#8209;get</code>,
either in CLI mode,
or &mdash; if you chose to install it as a permanent capability &mdash;
in GUI mode).
</li></ul>
<p>Regardless of which of the preceding options you choose,
<code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code> has completed its task;
when you proceed to the next stage of the installation process,
you will be running <code>mingw&#8209;get</code>,
<em>not</em>&hairsp; <code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code>.

<h3>Using the MinGW Installation Manager to Install Packages</h3>
<p>Once you have completed the installation of
<code><strong>mingw&#8209;get</strong></code>,
(which is also known,
particularly in its GUI guise,
as the &#8220;MinGW Installation Manager&#8221;),
you may use it to proceed with the installation of your choice of packages,
to complete (or subsequently extend) your MinGW installation.
Assuming that you have started the GUI variant of <code>mingw&#8209;get</code>,
either (having chosen to install it
at <a href="#step-1-ii">step ii of the set up procedure</a>)
as a free&#8209;standing application,
or by continuation from within <code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code>,
you will be presented with a three&#8209;paned window display,
whence you may proceed as follows:&ndash;
</p>
<ol class="setup-steps">
<li><img src="https://static-cdn.osdn.net/thumb/g/7/709/800x600_0.png"
 alt="Installer &mdash; Basic Package View"
/><div class="desc">
When <code>mingw&#8209;get</code> is invoked as a continuation
of <code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code>,
the initial three&#8209;paned view will appear as on the right;
(alternatively,
this view may be accessed by selecting
the <code>Basic</code>&#8197;<code>Setup</code>
option in the left&#8209;hand window pane,
at any time,
regardless of whether <code>mingw&#8209;get</code> is running
as a continuation of <code>mingw&#8209;get&#8209;setup.exe</code>,
or as a free&#8209;standing application).
<p>Within this view,
you will see a list (in the upper right&#8209;hand pane) of those packages
which are likely to be of most interest to first&#8209;time MinGW users;
you may select any one of these packages,
to see related package information on the tabs of
the lower right&#8209;hand pane,
and,
by clicking on the small square button,
to the left of any selected package entry,
you may choose (from its context menu) to mark one (or more) packages,
which you would like to install ...
for first&#8209;time users,
we recommend that you elect to install,
at least,
the <code>mingw32&#8209;base&#8209;bin</code> package,
(which comprises the C compiler and essential ancillary tools);
if you require a C++ compiler,
in addition to the C compiler,
you should also elect to install
the <code>mingw32&#8209;g++&#8209;bin</code> package.

Conversely,
when the GUI variant of <code>mingw&#8209;get</code> is invoked
as a free&#8209;standing application,
the initial three&#8209;paned view will appear as on the right;
(alternatively,
this view may be accessed by selecting the
<span class="nowrap"><code>All</code>&#8197;<code>Packages</code></span> option,
in the left&#8209;hand pane,
regardless of how <code>mingw&#8209;get</code> has been started).
<p>You may observe that,
in comparison with the
<span class="nowrap"><code>Basic</code>&#8197;<code>Setup</code></span> view,
this view offers a selection of many more packages,
from which you may choose those which you would like to install
... so many more that,
to see the entire selection,
you will need to scroll the list in the upper right window pane;
if you find this extensive package list to be too confusing,
you may refine the visible selection by clicking on
any of the subsidiary package categories,
as shown in the package category tree view,
in the left hand pane.
</p>
<p>As with selection of packages from the
<span class="nowrap"><code>Basic</code>&#8197;<code>Setup</code></span> view,
you may elect to install any packages which are visible in the
<span class="nowrap"><code>All</code>&#8197;<code>Packages</code></span> view,
making your selection by clicking on the small square button,
to the left of the name of each chosen package,
in turn,

Once you have made a selection of packages to be installed,
from either the
<span class="nowrap"><code>Basic</code>&#8197;<code>Setup</code></span> view,
or the
<span class="nowrap"><code>All</code>&#8197;<code>Packages</code></span> view,
as described above,
you must commit this selection,
to complete your installation,
by proceeding as follows:&ndash;
<ol>
<li>Open the <code>Installation</code> menu,
(on the menu bar),
and select the
<span class="nowrap"><code>Apply</code>&#8197;<code>Changes</code></span> option;
(this will open a dialogue,
similar to that shown to the right).</li>
<li>Review the schedule of pending installation actions,
(noting that you may need to scroll the lists of packages for which deletion,
upgrade, or installation actions have been scheduled,
for any of these lists which includes more than six package entries),
then choose <em>one</em>&hairsp; of:&ndash;
<ul>
<li>Click the <code>Apply</code> button,
to complete <em>all</em> scheduled actions,
update indicated installation status,
clear the schedule of pending actions,
and return to the selection phase of installation,
to allow initiation of a further package selection.</li>
<li>Click the <code>Defer</code> button,
if you would like to modify your package selection;
this will take you back to the package selection phase of installation,
to allow you to make your desired changes.</li>
<li>Click the <code>Discard</code> button,
if you do <em>not</em>&hairsp; wish to commit <em>any</em>&hairsp;
of the scheduled changes;
this will clear your active package selection,
then return you to the package selection phase of installation,
whence you may start the installation process again.</li>

from the <code>Installation</code> menu,
or by simply closing the <span class="nowrap">
&#8220;MinGW&#8197;Installation&#8197;Manager&#8221;</span> GUI window.
Having done so,
and in particular,
if you have just completed a first&#8209;time installation,
you may need to perform some post&#8209;installation system configuration,
as described in the following section,
to make your installation work.
<p style="display: none">
At this point,
if you plan to use the MSYS command line interpreter system,
your MinGW installation should be ready to use;
however,
if you choose to use MinGW from Microsoft&#8217;s

<h3>Post&#8209;Installation Requirements for Use of the MinGW Compiler Suite</h3>
<p>As noted above,
the process of installation alone
is likely to be insufficient to acquire a working MinGW system:
some additional one&#8209;time system configuration is usually required.
</p>
<p>Although some users may choose
to use an integrated development environment (IDE),
it is important to understand that, fundamentally,
MinGW applications are intended for deployment
using a command line interface (CLI);
the scope of the necessary system configuration
is dependent on <em>your</em>&hairsp; choice of infrastructure,
for provision of a suitable CLI,
or IDE.
Some choices,
which you may wish to consider,
include:&ndash;
</p>
<ol class="config-options">
<li>Run the MinGW tools <em>directly</em>,&hairsp;
using Microsoft&#8217;s <code>cmd.exe</code> interpreter,
within the MS&#8209;Windows default <span class="nowrap">
&#8220;<code>Command</code>&#8197;<code>Prompt</code>&#8221;
</span> console host.
If you choose this option,
(which may <em>not</em>&hairsp; be the most appropriate choice),
you will, at least, need to ensure that the MinGW tools can be found
in the <code>cmd.exe</code> executable search <code>PATH</code>,
as configured in the process environment.
The default system configuration will not normally support
this capability, without making an appropriate <code>PATH</code> adjustment;
to check if any such adjustment is necessary:&ndash;
<ul>
<li>Open a <code>Command</code>&#8197;<code>Prompt</code> console,
and run the command:
<pre class="vt box-out">
C:\Users\me&gt; <kbd>gcc --version</kbd>
</pre>
If this results in output similar to:
<pre class="vt box-out">
C:\Users\me&gt; <kbd>gcc --version</kbd>
gcc (MinGW GCC Build-2) 9.2.0
Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
</pre>
then it appears that your process <code>PATH</code> setting
<em>is already</em>&hairsp; suitably configured,
and <em>no further</em>&hairsp; configuration is needed;
however, if the output resembles:
<pre class="vt box-out">
C:\Users\me&gt; <kbd>gcc --version</kbd>
'gcc' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</pre>
this, then the <code>PATH</code> setting in the process environment
<em>is not</em>&hairsp; suitably configured;
you <em>should</em>&hairsp; modify the environment configuration,
as advised below.
</li></ul>
<p>Additionally,
a number of MinGW applications&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;any comtemporary
version of the GNU Debugger being a notable example&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;may
require a definition of the <code>HOME</code> environment variable.
Typically,
<code>Unix</code> systems define this,
to represent the path name of the current user&#8217;s
default working directory,
but MS&#8209;Windows uses the <code>USERPROFILE</code> variable
for this purpose,
so <code>HOME</code> is not normally defined.
</p>
<p>To check whether the <code>HOME</code> variable is defined,
or not:&ndash;
</p>
<ul><li>Run the command:
<pre class="vt box-out">
C:\Users\me&gt; <kbd>echo %HOME%</kbd>
</pre>
in a <code>Command</code>&#8197;<code>Prompt</code> console window;
if <code>HOME</code> has been suitably configured,
this should produce output similar to:
<pre class="vt box-out">
C:\Users\me&gt; <kbd>echo %HOME%</kbd>
C:\Users\me
</pre>
but it is more likely to produce no output at all,
in which case you should consider adding a <code>HOME</code> variable
definition to your environment variables configuration.
</li></ul>
<p>If the preceding checks indicate that
the <code>PATH</code> configuration needs to be adjusted,
or that the <code>HOME</code> variable has not been defined,
then you should proceed as follows:&ndash;
</p><ul>
<li>From the system <span class="nowrap">
<code>Control</code>&#8197;<code>Panel</code></span>,
open the <code>System</code> tab,
access the <span class="nowrap">
<code>Advanced</code>&#8197;<code>system</code>&#8197;<code>settings</code>
</span> dialogue,
and click the <span class="nowrap">
<code>Environment</code>&#8197;<code>Variables</code></span> button.
</li>
<li>In the dialogue,
which should now have become active,
observe that there are two categories of environment variables,
viz. a category for user&#8209;specific variables,
and another for system (global) variables.
Please note that any environment variables,
which you either add, or modify, in either of these categories,
will be recorded in the system registry,
and will become visible to <em>all</em>&hairsp; processes
which are subsequently invoked on the system,
(although visibility of those in the user&#8209;specific category
will be restricted to processes owned by the currently&#8209;logged&#8209;in
user), and that changes to the <code>PATH</code> variable have potential
to introduce system security vulnerabilities;
thus, you should exercise caution,
when making such changes, and,
unless it is your intention that your changes should affect
<em>all users</em>&hairsp; of the system,
you should prefer to make the change <em>only</em>&hairsp;
in the user&#8209;specific category,
in order to limit the potential of any vulnerability.
</li>
<li>Note that <code>mingw&#8209;get</code> will have installed
MinGW applications into <code>C:\MinGW\bin</code>,
(with substitution of any alternative installation&#8209;root path name,
which you may have chosen at installation time,
for the <code>C:\MinGW</code> prefix);
it is this equivalent for the <code>C:\MinGW\bin</code> path name,
(with prefix substitution as may be appropriate),
which you must now incorporate into the <code>PATH</code> variable,
to be passed in the environment,
to your <span class="nowrap">
<code>Command</code>&#8197;<code>Prompt</code></span> process.
</li>
<li>Within the environment variables category
in which you have decided to adjust the <code>PATH</code> setting,
identify the entry (matching the variable name
<em>case&#8209;insensitively</em>&hairsp;),
if it exists, for the <code>PATH</code> variable definition.
</li>
<li>If the <code>PATH</code> variable definition <em>does</em>&hairsp;
already exist, select it, and click the <code>Edit</code> button;
move the input cursor to the <em>end</em>&hairsp; of the
<code>Value</code> field,
and append a semicolon (&#8220;<code>;</code>&#8221;),
followed by your equivalent for <code>C:\MinGW\bin</code>,
with prefix substitution as required.
</li>
<li>Conversely, if no such <code>PATH</code> variable exists,
click the <code>New</code> button, and create a new entry for it;
assign your equivalent for <code>C:\MinGW\bin</code>,
with prefix substitution as required,
as its value.
</li>
<li>Similarly, to add a definition for the <code>HOME</code> variable,
click the <code>New</code> button, and create the requisite entry;
it should be given a suitable value, which typically, could be to
inherit the value of the <code>USERPROFILE</code> variable.
</li>
<li>Click the <code>OK</code> button on each nested dialogue box,
as you walk focus back to the top level of the <span class="nowrap">
<code>Control</code>&#8197;<code>Panel</code></span>,
so saving your environment variable changes,
then dismiss the <span class="nowrap">
<code>Control</code>&#8197;<code>Panel</code></span> itself.
</li></ul>
<p>After you have completed the above system configuration steps,
you may open a standard MS&#8209;Windows <span class="nowrap">
<code>Command</code>&#8197;<code>Prompt</code></span> console session,
and you <em>should</em>&hairsp; find that your MinGW tools will work,
without further ado.
</p></li>
<li>As a (possibly better) alternative to option
<span class="smaller">1</span>,
you may still choose to run the MinGW tools directly from
Microsoft&#8217;s <code>cmd.exe</code> command line interpreter,
but with this interpreter hosted within a console session which has
been started from a customized &#8220;shortcut&#8221;,
which itself addresses the issue of adding the equivalent of
<code>C:\MinGW\bin</code> to the <code>PATH</code>
environment variable setting;
this ensures that the modified <code>PATH</code> setting is visible
<em>only</em>&hairsp; to processes which are invoked from within
the hosting console session itself, and thus
<em>significantly</em>&hairsp; reduces any associated potential
for exposure to system security vulnerability exploits.
<p>To implement this <code>PATH</code> configuration technique:&ndash;
</p><ul>
<li>Create a new &#8220;shortcut&#8221;,
ideally within the <code>MinGW</code> subdirectory
(folder) of your user&#8209;specific
<span class="nowrap"><code>Start</code>&#8197;<code>Menu</code></span>,
(or, if preferred, in the <code>MinGW</code> subdirectory of the
<span class="nowrap"><code>All</code>&#8197;<code>Users</code></span>
<span class="nowrap"><code>Start</code>&#8197;<code>Menu</code></span>,
noting that you may need to create the respective <span class="nowrap">
<code>"Start</code>&#8197;<code>Menu\MinGW"</code></span> subdirectory,
if it does not already exist);
you should name this new &#8220;shortcut&#8221; as
<span class="nowrap"><code>"MinGW</code>&#8197;<code>Prompt.lnk"</code>,</span>
<span class="nowrap"><code>"MinGW</code>&#8197;<code>Console.lnk"</code>,</span>
or any similar alternative name of your own choice.
<li>Set the <code>Target</code> of your new &#8220;shortcut&#8221; to:
<pre class="vt box-out">
<kbd>%comspec% /c path %PATH%;C:\MinGW\bin&amp;set HOME=%USERPROFILE%&amp;%comspec%</kbd>
</pre>
(with substitution for <code>C:\MinGW</code>, as appropriate,
if you chose an alternative prefix at installation time).
Alternatively, create a new MS&#8209;Windows batch file,
(called <span class="nowrap"><code>C:\MinGW\mingw.bat</code>,</span>
for example), with content similar to:
<pre class="vt box-out">
<kbd>set HOME=%USERPROFILE%</kbd>
<kbd>path %PATH%;C:\MinGW\bin</kbd>
<kbd>%comspec%</kbd>
</pre>
and set the &#8220;shortcut&#8221; <code>Target</code> to:
<pre class="vt box-out">
<kbd>%comspec% /c C:\MinGW\mingw.bat</kbd>
</pre>
(This latter alternative offers greater flexibility than the former,
insofar as the batch file may be modified to accommodate configuration
options beyond the minimally required <code>PATH</code> augmentation,
and the recommended <code>HOME</code> variable assignment).
</li>
<li>Access the properties of the new &#8220;shortcut&#8221;,
and set the start&#8209;up directory path name, within the
<span class="nowrap"><code>Start</code>&#8197;<code>in</code></span>
field, to select any appropriate directory of your choice;
if you wish to reproduce the behaviour of the standard MS&#8209;Windows
<span class="nowrap"><code>Command</code>&#8197;<code>Prompt</code>,</span>
the appropriate assignment is:
<pre class="vt box-out">
<kbd>%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%</kbd>
</pre>
At the same time,
you may wish to take the opportunity to tweak &#8220;shortcut&#8221;
properties on the <code>Font</code>, <code>Layout</code>,
and <code>Colors</code> tabs.
</li></ul></li>
<li>If you chose to install MSYS,
and you would like to use it as your working MinGW development environment,
in preference to the rather more limited capabilities of the MS&#8209;Windows
<span class="nowrap"><code>Command</code>&#8197;<code>Prompt</code>,</span>
then some associated configuration checks are recommended:&ndash;
<ul>
<li>Firstly,
you may need to create a &#8220;shortcut&#8221;,
ideally within your user&#8209;specific
<span class="nowrap"><code>Start</code>&#8197;<code>Menu</code>,</span>
or within the
<span class="nowrap"><code>All</code>&#8197;<code>Users</code>,</span>
<span class="nowrap"><code>Start</code>&#8197;<code>Menu</code>;</span>
the recommended name for this &#8220;shortcut&#8221; is
<span class="nowrap"><code>MinGW</code>&#8197;<code>Shell</code>,</span>
and its <code>Target</code> should be set to invoke:
<pre class="vt box-out">
<kbd>C:\MinGW\MSYS\1.0\msys.bat</kbd>
</pre>
(with the path name adjusted, as may be required,
to represent the actual installed location of <code>msys.bat</code>).
</li>
<li>Secondly,
your MSYS installation <em>must</em>&hairsp; be given an appropriate
hint to the base location of your MinGW tools.
This is established by means of a &#8220;mount&nbsp;point&#8221;
specification, within the <span class="nowrap">
<code>C:\MinGW\MSYS\1.0\etc\fstab</code></span> file,
(again, with the <span class="nowrap"><code>C:\MinGW\MSYS\1.0</code></span>
path name adjusted to match the prefix,
in the actual location of the <code>msys.bat</code> file);
if this file does not exist, you should create it,
but in any case, you <em>must</em>&hairsp; ensure that it
includes (at least) a line of the form:
<pre class="vt box-out">
<kbd>C:/MinGW	/mingw</kbd>
</pre>
(again noting that the <code>C:/MinGW</code> prefix should be adjusted
to match any alternative, which you may have chosen at installation time,
and furthermore, &#8220;<code>/</code>&#8221; characters should be used
as directory name separators, in preference to &#8220;<code>\</code>&#8221;
characters, within the <code>etc/fstab</code> file).
</li></ul>
<p>You may be wondering why these post&#8209;installation instructions,
for MSYS, do not refer to <code>PATH</code> configuration.
In practice, no specific configuration is necessary, because,
provided the <code>/mingw</code> &#8220;mount&#8209;point&#8221;
is correctly specified in the <code>fstab</code> file,
MSYS will correctly deduce the required <code>PATH</code> setting,
when any shell session is started.
However, it <em>is</em>&hairsp; important to note that it is
<em>imperative</em>&hairsp; that <em>no white&#8209;space</em>&hairsp;
is present, within the absolute path name specification for the
&#8220;mount&#8209;point&#8221;;
thus, since this <em>must</em>&hairsp; be specified as
an <em>absolute</em>&hairsp; path name, if,
contrary to offered advice,
you have chosen an installation directory with white&#8209;space
in its absolute path name,
you will need to determine the short (8.3) form of your
installation path name,
and use that in the &#8220;mount&#8209;point&#8221; specification.
</p></li>
<li>Regardless of whether you choose to run the MinGW tools
within an MSYS session, or within a <code>cmd.exe</code> session, by default,
either of these will run within an MS&#8209;Windows console host
container.
If you prefer, you may choose an alternative container, such as
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://conemu.github.io">
ConEmu</a>,
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/bozho/console">
Console2</a>, or
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/cbucher/console">
ConsoleZ</a>.
While it should be feasible to use any of these,
each will have its own configuration considerations,
which are beyond the scope of this HOWTO document.
</li>
<li>Alternatively,
you may decide that you would prefer to deploy MinGW within an IDE.
Please be aware that MinGW.OSDN offers no formal support for any such
deployment; however, users have reported success with
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.codeblocks.org">
Code::Blocks</a>, and with
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eclipse.org">
Eclipse</a>,
(but be advised that these third&#8209;party websites may
may exhibit out&#8209;of&#8209;date references to MinGW download sites;
the most up&#8209;to&#8209;date downloads of MinGW are <em>always</em>&hairsp;
available from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
href="https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/">OSDN.net</a>).
As with option <span class="smaller">4</span>,
each of these IDEs will be subject to its own configuration considerations,
which, once again, are beyond the scope of this HOWTO document.

<h3>Maintaining Currency of your MinGW Installation</h3>
<p>After you have installed your initial choice of MinGW,
and/or MSYS packages,
you will eventually discover that you need to perform some degree
of maintenance of your installation;
this need may be prompted by:&ndash;
</p><ul>
<li>A desire to install additional packages,
which you had not chosen to include within your original installation.
</li>
<li>Availability of newer releases of those packages,
which you have previously installed;
you will wish to upgrade your existing installation,
to take advantage of any such newer package releases.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of your motivation
for performing maintenance on your MinGW installation,
it is recommended that you use <code>mingw&#8209;get</code>,
either in its GUI, or in its CLI mode of operation,
to achieve your objective.
</p>
<p>Whether your intention is to install a new package,
or simply to upgrade an installed package to a newer release,
you should ensure that the package information records, within
your locally installed copy of <code>mingw&#8209;get</code>,
are kept up&#8209;to&#8209;date with respect to the state of
the online package repositories.
To achieve this,
you are advised to periodically,
(say, if it has been more than a week since your update),
request an update of your local copy of the package catalogue,
<em>before</em>&hairsp; you embark on any package installation,
or package upgrade activity.
You may accomplish this, either:&ndash;
</p><ul>
<li>From the <code>mingw&#8209;get</code> GUI,
by selecting the <span class="nowrap">
<code>Update</code>&#8197;<code>Catalogue</code></span> option
from the <code>Installation</code> menu.
<li>From the MinGW CLI, simply by running the command:
<pre class="vt box-out">
C:\Users\me&gt; <kbd>mingw-get update</kbd>
</pre>
</li></ul>
<p>After updating your package catalogue,
to synchronize with the online package repository state,
you may install further packages:&ndash;
</p><ul>
<li>From the <code>mingw&#8209;get</code> GUI,
by following the procedure described in <a href="#install-packages">
section <span class="smaller">2</span>, above</a>.
</li>
<li>From the MinGW CLI, by running the command:
<pre class="vt box-out">
C:\Users\me&gt; <kbd>mingw-get install</kbd> &lt;<em>package-name</em>&gt;
</pre>
</li></ul>
<p>When a new version of any package,
which you have already installed, is released,
you will want to upgrade your installation,
to incorporate the package changes.
Once again, you can perform the upgrade from either
the <code>mingw&#8209;get</code> GUI,
or the MinGW CLI;
the simplest procedure,
which will upgrade <em>all</em>&hairsp; installed packages,
for which new releases are available,
<em>en masse</em>,&hairsp; is&ndash;
</p><ul>
<li>From the <code>Installation</code> menu of
the <code>mingw&#8209;get</code> GUI,
select the <span class="nowrap">
<code>Mark</code>&#8197;<code>All</code>&#8197;<code>Upgrades</code>
</span> option, followed by the <span class="nowrap">
<code>Apply</code>&#8197;<code>Changes</code>,</span>
then review, and commit the changes,
following the procedure described in
<a href="#step-2-iii">section <span class="smaller">2</span>, step iii</a>,
above.
</li>
<li>From the MinGW CLI, execute the command:
<pre class="vt box-out">
C:\Users\me&gt; <kbd>mingw-get upgrade</kbd>
</pre>
(without <em>any</em>&hairsp; <span class="nowrap">
<code>&lt;<em>package-name</em>&gt;</code></span> argument);
this CLI method performs <em>identically</em>&hairsp; the same
<em>en masse</em>&#8209; upgrade as the GUI method, <em>except</em>&hairsp;
that it offers <em>no opportunity</em>&hairsp; for review of the scheduled
changes, prior to <em>unconditionally</em>&hairsp; committing them.
</li></ul>
<p>Alternatively,
you may choose to perform a <em>selective</em>&hairsp; upgrade
of individual packages:&ndash;
</p><ul>
<li>In the <code>mingw&#8209;get</code> GUI,
by selecting the <span class="nowrap">
<code>Mark</code>&#8197;<code>for</code>&#8197;<code>Upgrade</code>
</span> option, in the context menu which is attached to the status icon
to the left of the package list entry for each package of interest;
(those packages, for which upgrades are available, are identified
by a yellow star, in the upper right corner of the status icon).
<p>After selecting packages to upgrade,
once again select the <span class="nowrap">
<code>Apply</code>&#8197;<code>Changes</code></span> option
from the <code>Installation</code> menu,
and proceed as in <a href="#step-2-iii">
section <span class="smaller">2</span>, step iii</a>.
</p></li>
<li>From the MinGW CLI, execute the command:
<pre class="vt box-out">
C:\Users\me&gt; <kbd>mingw-get upgrade</kbd> &lt;<em>package-name</em>&gt;
</pre>
for each package which you wish to upgrade,
(which will also, implicitly, identify each additional upgradeable package
upon which each specified package is dependent).
</li></ul>
