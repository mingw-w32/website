<!-- FIXME: is there a better way to do this?  We need to propagate
 content to the "as-page-title" and "as-page-subtitle" place-holders,
 within the "page-content" div of "index.html"; our javascript page
 loader will explicitly look for these hidden elements, and copy
 their content into the corresponding visible place-holders.
