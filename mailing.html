<p>MinGW.org&#8217;s preferred method for communication,
between users and the project team, is by way of mailing&#8209;lists.
Historically, there were several topic&#8209;specific lists, originally
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw/mailman/"
>hosted on SourceForge.net</a>;
today, only two remain operational, and both are
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/lists/"
>hosted on OSDN.net</a>.
</p>
<h3>Operational Mailing&#8209;Lists</h3>
<p>The currently operational
MinGW.org mailing&#8209;lists are:&mdash;
</p>
<dl class="no-indent overlapped" id="mingw-users">
<dt><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://lists.osdn.me/mailman/listinfo/mingw-users"
>MinGW&#8209;Users Mailing&#8209;List</a>
</dt>
<dd>This is the primary conduit for dialogue between MinGW users
and the MinGW.org project team;
(you are advised to use this mailing&#8209;list
at any time when you wish to engage in such dialogue).
It is a public mailing&#8209;list, but to avoid spam,
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://lists.osdn.me/mailman/listinfo/mingw-users"
>you <em>must</em> subscribe</a>
<em>before</em> you will be
permitted to post your first message,
(and your subscription <em>must</em> remain active,
if you wish to post subsequent messages).
</dd>
<dd>Before
posting to this mailing&#8209;list
you are advised to acquaint yourself with the
<a href="#list-etiquette">posting etiquette</a>;
failure to comply with this etiquette may seriously impair
your chances of receiving a useful response,
and, in cases of flagrant disregard,
may even result in your future posts being moderated.
</dd>
<dd>Previous correspondence,
posted to this mailing&#8209;list between February&nbsp;2018
and the present day, has been
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/lists/archive/users"
>archived on OSDN.net</a>;
(earlier correspondence, prior to February&nbsp;2018, has also been
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw/mailman/mingw-users"
>archived, on SourceForge.net</a>).
As noted in the <a href="#list-etiquette">etiquette</a>,
before you introduce a new topic on this mailing&#8209;list,
you are advised to search these archives,
to ensure that you are not asking a question
which has already been answered.
You may use the following pair of search boxes to perform
keyword searches within the OSDN.net (upper),
and the SourceForge.net (lower box) archives, respectively.
(If your question relates to MSYS, you may also wish to refer to the
<a href="#mingw-msys">historical MinGW&#8209;MSYS archive, below</a>).

<dd>This is a <em>read&#8209;only</em> mailing&#8209;list,

If you would like to receive such notifications,
you are welcome to subscribe to this mailing&#8209;list,
but please <em>do not</em> attempt to post messages to it.

<dd>Notifications posted to this mailing&#8209;list,

<h3>Historical Mailing&#8209;List Archives</h3>
<p>In earlier days of the project history,
the volume of mailing&#8209;list traffic was significantly greater
than it is today.
This traffic was distributed over five topic&#8209;specific
mailing&#8209;lists, of which only the two identified above
remain operational today;
the other three historical lists, which are identified below,
are now closed, and it is no longer possible to subscribe,
or to post messages to them.
However, archives of historical postings remain
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw/mailman/"
>available on SourceForge.net</a>,
and may be searched using their respective keyword&#8209;search boxes,
below.

</dt>
<dd>This was a public mailing&#8209;list,
dedicated to correspondence relating specifically to MSYS,
in order to segregate it from more general MinGW&#8209;Users list traffic;
today, such correspondence should be directed to

<h3>Mailing&#8209;List Posting Etiquette</h3>
<p>MinGW is an open source project.
As such, it is heavily dependent on people who dedicate
their spare time to the goals and continuing development of the project,
so please keep this in mind when posting to the mailing&#8209;list.
</p>
<p>Before you post, you are advised to
acquaint yourself with the following commonly accepted guidelines,
with which you are strongly encouraged to comply,
when composing your posts.
Failure to comply with these guidelines may result
in your posts being ignored by a number of knowledgeable people,
and repeated offenses may even lead to your posts being vetted,
and potentially rejected, by the list moderator.
</p>
<ul style="padding-right: 1em">
<li>The language of the lists is <em><strong>English</strong></em>&hairsp;;
if you post in any other language, you are unlikely to elicit a response.
</li>
<li><em><strong>Do search</strong></em> the mailing list archives,
(both the current archives, and those of the historical topic&#8209;specific
lists), before posting, (see the links associated with each of the lists above);
many questions have already been asked and answered.
</li>
<li><em><strong>Do use</strong></em>
a <em><strong>meaningful</strong></em> subject line.
A subject line should include a pertinent few words summarizing
the subject of the email;
(when one replies to emails,
one should always make certain the subject line of the email is still
relevant to the reply).
In particular, if you receive list mail in digest format,
<em><strong>do always</strong></em>
set the subject back to the original text,
from the message to which you are replying.
<em><strong>Do not</strong></em> reply with a subject of
<em>&#8220;Re: MinGW-??? Digest no. ???&#8221;</em>;
such replies are prime candidates for deletion, without being read.
</li>
<li><em><strong>Do post</strong></em> in a MIME format with
<em>&#8220;Content-Type: text</em>/<em>plain&#8221;</em>.
<em><strong>Do not</strong></em> post as HTML, or in any other MIME format,
(and in particular, <em><strong>do not</strong></em> use multi-part MIME,
with plain text duplicated as HTML);
some list subscribers are unable to, or choose not to read such mail,
and will be unable or unwilling to answer you.
</li>
<li><em><strong>Do not</strong></em>
post messages with very long lines of text;
except when pasting screenshots, where line wrapping might lead to confusion,
ensure that lines of running text are wrapped with hard line breaks,
at a length of between 65 and 72 characters.
</li>
<li><em><strong>Do quote</strong></em> sections of the original text,
and <em><strong>interleave</strong></em> your replies to individual points,
<em><strong>below</strong></em> the relevant context.
<em><strong>Do not</strong></em> 
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_post"
>top-post</a>;
(this 
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
 href="http://redballoon.net/~snorwood/quote-rant.shtml"
>treatise</a>
explains why top-posting is considered unacceptable).
</li>
<li><em><strong>Do trim out</strong></em> sections of the original mail,
which are not required to establish the context of your reply.
(Once more,
this is particularly important when replying to mail received in digest form;
<em><strong>do reply</strong></em>
to <em><strong>one subject at a time</strong></em>,
and <em><strong>do remove</strong></em> all content related to other subjects).
<em><strong>Do not</strong></em> persistently recycle irrelevant junk,
quoted from earlier messages in the thread.
</li>
<li><em><strong>Do not</strong></em>
include <em>&#8220;legal mumble&#8221;</em> signatures.
You are posting to a list that will be read by thousands of users,
and anything you say will be archived in the public domain;
in this context, such drivel in your signature is neither enforceable,
nor meaningful.
</li>
<li><em><strong>Do not hijack</strong></em> an existing topic thread,
when you wish to introduce an unrelated subject;
(i.e. <em><strong>do not</strong></em> reply to an existing message,
when your reply is unrelated to the original subject).
When you want to introduce a new topic, plainly start a new thread,
(i.e. a completely new message).
Replying in an existing thread confuses mail readers
and humans who are trying to participate in the original discussion;
it is a sure way to irritate other subscribers,
and will likely get you ignored,
if not even black-listed.
</li>
</ul>

in a manner most likely to elicit useful replies.
